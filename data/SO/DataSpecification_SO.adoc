== *How to read the document?*

This document describes the _"INSPIRE data specification on Soil â€“ Technical Guidelines"_ version 3.0 as developed by the Thematic Working Group (TWG) _TWG-Soil_ using both natural and a conceptual schema language.

The data specification is based on a common templatefootnote:[The common document template is available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2] used for all data specifications, which has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I, II and III data specifications.

This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the Implementing Rule for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. It also includes additional requirements and recommendations that, although not included in the Implementing Rule, are relevant to guarantee or to increase data interoperability.

Two executive summaries provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on _Soil_ in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first.

The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of _Soil_, but also to other stakeholders and users of the spatial data infrastructure.

The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes.

In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the spatial object types, the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in _italics._

== *Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services â€“ General Executive Summary*

The challenges regarding the lack of availability, quality, organisation, accessibility, and sharing of spatial information are common to a large number of policies and activities and are experienced across the various levels of public authority in Europe. In order to solve these problems it is necessary to take measures of coordination between the users and providers of spatial information. The Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council adopted on 14 March 2007 aims at establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) for environmental policies, or policies and activities that have an impact on the environment.

INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created and maintained by the Member States. To support the establishment of a European infrastructure, Implementing Rules addressing the following components of the infrastructure have been specified: metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets (as described in Annexes I, II, III of the Directive) and spatial data services, network services, data and service sharing, and monitoring and reporting procedures.

INSPIRE does not require collection of new data. However, after the period specified in the Directivefootnote:[For all 34 Annex I,II and III data themes: within two years of the adoption of the corresponding Implementing Rules for newly collected and extensively restructured data and within 5 years for other data in electronic format still in use] Member States have to make their data available according to the Implementing Rules.

Interoperability in INSPIRE means the possibility to combine spatial data and services from different sources across the European Community in a consistent way without involving specific efforts of humans or machines. It is important to note that "interoperability" is understood as providing access to spatial data sets through network services, typically via Internet. Interoperability may be achieved by either changing (harmonising) and storing existing data sets or transforming them via services for publication in the INSPIRE infrastructure. It is expected that users will spend less time and efforts on understanding and integrating data when they build their applications based on data delivered in accordance with INSPIRE.

In order to benefit from the endeavours of international standardisation bodies and organisations established under international law their standards and technical means have been utilised and referenced, whenever possible.

To facilitate the implementation of INSPIRE, it is important that all stakeholders have the opportunity to participate in specification and development. For this reason, the Commission has put in place a consensus building process involving data users, and providers together with representatives of industry, research and government. These stakeholders, organised through Spatial Data Interest Communities (SDIC) and Legally Mandated Organisations (LMO)footnote:[The current status of registered SDICs/LMOs is available via INSPIRE website: http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/42], have provided reference materials, participated in the user requirement and technicalfootnote:[Surveys on unique identifiers and usage of the elements of the spatial and temporal schema,] surveys, proposed experts for the Data Specification Drafting Teamfootnote:[The Data Specification Drafting Team has been composed of experts from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, UK, and the European Environment Agency], the Thematic Working Groupsfootnote:[The Thematic Working Groups have been composed of experts from Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, the European Environment Agency and the European Commission.] and other ad-hoc cross-thematic technical groups and participated in the public stakeholder consultations on draft versions of the data specifications. These consultations covered expert reviews as well as feasibility and fitness-for-purpose testing of the data specificationsfootnote:[For Annex IIIII, the consultation and testing phase lasted from 20 June to 21 October 2011.].

This open and participatory approach was successfully used during the development of the data specifications on Annex I, II and III data themes as well as during the preparation of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[Commission Regulation (EU) NoÂ 1089/2010 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:323:SOM:EN:HTML[implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services,] published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 8^th^ of December 2010.] for Annex I spatial data themes and of its amendment regarding the themes of Annex II and III.

The development framework elaborated by the Data Specification Drafting Team aims at keeping the data specifications of the different themes coherent. It summarises the methodology to be used for the development of the data specifications, providing a coherent set of requirements and recommendations to achieve interoperability. The pillars of the framework are the following technical documentsfootnote:[The framework documents are available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2]:

* The _Definition of Annex Themes and Scope_ describes in greater detail the spatial data themes defined in the Directive, and thus provides a sound starting point for the thematic aspects of the data specification development.
* The _Generic Conceptual Model_ defines the elements necessary for interoperability and data harmonisation including cross-theme issues. It specifies requirements and recommendations with regard to data specification elements of common use, like the spatial and temporal schema, unique identifier management, object referencing, some common code lists, etc. Those requirements of the Generic Conceptual Model that are directly implementable are included in the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services.
* The _Methodology for the Development of Data Specifications_ defines a repeatable methodology. It describes how to arrive from user requirements to a data specification through a number of steps including use-case development, initial specification development and analysis of analogies and gaps for further specification refinement.
* The _Guidelines for the Encoding of Spatial Data_ defines how geographic information can be encoded to enable transfer processes between the systems of the data providers in the Member States. Even though it does not specify a mandatory encoding rule it sets GML (ISO 19136) as the default encoding for INSPIRE.
* The _Guidelines for the use of Observations & Measurements and Sensor Web Enablement-related standards in INSPIRE Annex II and III data specification development_ provides guidelines on how the "Observations and Measurements" standard (ISO 19156) is to be used within INSPIRE.
* The _Common data models_ are a set of documents that specify data models that are referenced by a number of different data specifications. These documents include generic data models for networks, coverages and activity complexes.

The structure of the data specifications is based on the "ISO 19131 Geographic information - Data product specifications" standard. They include the technical documentation of the application schema, the spatial object types with their properties, and other specifics of the spatial data themes using natural language as well as a formal conceptual schema languagefootnote:[UML â€“ Unified Modelling Language].

A consolidated model repository, feature concept dictionary, and glossary are being maintained to support the consistent specification development and potential further reuse of specification elements. The consolidated model consists of the harmonised models of the relevant standards from the ISO 19100 series, the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model, and the application schemasfootnote:[Conceptual models related to specific areas (e.g. INSPIRE themes)] developed for each spatial data theme. The multilingual INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary contains the definition and description of the INSPIRE themes together with the definition of the spatial object types present in the specification. The INSPIRE Glossary defines all the terms (beyond the spatial object types) necessary for understanding the INSPIRE documentation including the terminology of other components (metadata, network services, data sharing, and monitoring).

By listing a number of requirements and making the necessary recommendations, the data specifications enable full system interoperability across the Member States, within the scope of the application areas targeted by the Directive. The data specifications (in their version 3.0) are published as technical guidelines and provide the basis for the content of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[In the case of the Annex IIIII data specifications, the extracted requirements are used to formulate an amendment to the existing Implementing Rule.]. The content of the Implementing Rule is extracted from the data specifications, considering short- and medium-term feasibility as well as cost-benefit considerations. The requirements included in the Implementing Rule are legally binding for the Member States according to the timeline specified in the INSPIRE Directive.

In addition to providing a basis for the interoperability of spatial data in INSPIRE, the data specification development framework and the thematic data specifications can be reused in other environments at local, regional, national and global level contributing to improvements in the coherence and interoperability of data in spatial data infrastructures.

== *_Soil_ â€“ Executive Summary*

For the purpose of the data specification in this document, soil is the upper part of the earth's crust, formed by mineral particles, organic matter, water, air and living organisms. It is the interface between rock, air and water which hosts most of the biosphere. Soil is subject to a series of threats as recognized not only in the EU Soil Thematic Strategy (COM(2006)231 final), but indirectly also in several adopted EU Directives (e.g. 1999/31/EC, 91/676/EEC, 86/278/EC..). The requirements of these directives were considered while compiling this data specification.

Based on the definition given by the Directive (2007/2/EC), the scope for the soil theme covers:

[loweralpha]
. *Soil inventories*, providing one-off assessments of soil conditions and/or soil properties at certain locations and at a specific point in time, and allow soil monitoring, providing a series of assessments showing how soil conditions and/or properties change over time.
. *Soil mapping*, providing a spatial presentation of the properties linked to the soils, including soil types; typically, soil maps are derived with the help of data available in soil inventories. Also other soil related information derived from soil properties, possibly in combination with non-soil data are within the scope.

The INSPIRE methodology was used (D2.6). The input from the Member States was used for defining 15 Use cases covering Agro-Environmental Indicators, Soil Derived Information, Contaminated sites and Soil Monitoring (see Annex B). Based on these Use cases, together with the expert knowledge present in the thematic working group (TWG), the data model was built and validated.

The comments from the Member State consultation and the testing were used to improve the data model.

The data model contains a core set of spatial object types and their attributes that are considered to be essential for the infrastructure along which data on soil can be exchanged. In addition to the core _Soil_ data model an extension data model (including application schema) deals with the management of soil contamination (see Annex D). This model extension demonstrates how the core _Soil_ data model can be extended to include more specific requirements (soil contamination) that were identified by the Use cases.

The TWG has also prepared an example of how a soil derived theme - soil organic carbon - can be provided utilising the core _Soil_ data model. (see Annex D)

The soil observable parameters relevant for some approved EU Directives are included in the model in the spatial object types SoilProfile, ProfileElement, SoilDerivedObject and SoilThemeCoverage.

The data specification is based, as far as possible, on existing standards. Apart from general ISO19xxx standards used in relation to geographical information, use was also made of the ISO DIS 28258 (Draft International Standard/Soil Quality) standard. As soil contains many observable and measurable parameters, the specialised use of the ISO 19156:2011 Observations and Measurements standard is proposed. Based on the soil community practise to provide thematic soil map information in a raster form, this option is provided for by utilising the ISO 19123 Coverages standard.

To enhance semantic interoperability the use of the soil classification scheme WRB (World Reference Base for Soil Resources) and the FAO horizon notation scheme as primary classification systems are proposed. The use of other currently used (local, regional, national) classification systems is also provided for.

== Scope

This document specifies a harmonised data specification for the spatial data theme _Soil_ as defined in Annex III of the INSPIRE Directive.

This data specification provides the basis for the drafting of Implementing Rules according to Article 7 (1) of the INSPIRE Directive [Directive 2007/2/EC]. The entire data specification is published as implementation guidelines accompanying these Implementing Rules.

== Overview

=== Name

INSPIRE data specification for the theme _Soil_.

=== Informal description

*Definition:*

Soils and subsoil characterised according to depth, texture, structure and content of particles and organic material, stoniness, erosion, where appropriate mean slope and anticipated water storage capacity. [Directive 2007/2/EC]

*Description:*

Soil is a non-renewable resource at the human scale, which is important for many parts of society. In many places in the world, soil degradation is a serious process threatening that soil can fulfil its functions in the future. In the climate change debate, soil is becoming important in relation to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Soil degradation may result in soils that no longer can fulfil services like food production, or being so contaminated that they form a threat for human and/or ecological health.

Soil is subject to a series of threats as recognized in the EU Soil Thematic Strategy (COM(2006)231 final): erosion, organic matter decline, contamination, salinisation, sodification, compaction, soil biodiversity loss, sealing, landslides and flooding. Also soil acidification is generally considered to be a problem in humid areas. Information on soils is crucial to make fundamental decisions and to protect the soil against degradation processes.

The need for soil information can vary from improvement of agricultural and forestry production, prevention of environment damage due to human activities, or to getting to know the location and extent of sites with high concentrations of harmful substances. There is a high demand for soil information in relation to carbon sequestration (climate change), the prevention of soil degradation, improvement of agricultural production (e.g. food and bio-energy crops) and for the mitigation of desertification in areas with arid and semi-arid climatic conditions.

In order to provide meaningful use and to share and exchange information in the field of soil, part of the world of soil (seen as a Universe of Discourse (UoD)) is to be modelled. The soil UoD is defined and limited by the problems that need to be solved and the solutions that are to be provided through the use of soil information. The kind of soil information is suggested by Use Cases (preferably underpinned by legislation) that have been identified by the TWG-SO based on input from INSPIRE stakeholders and by the expertise available in the expert group.

The following use cases are identified and described in Annex B:

* *Agri-Environmental Indicators:*
** Use Case Environmental Indicator Soil Erosion
** Use Case Environmental Indicator Soil Quality
** Use Case Environmental Indicator Contaminated Sites
* *Thematic maps derived from soil information*
** Land irrigation suitability in Navarra (Spain)
** Development of methodologies for soil salinity surveillance in the middle Ebro basin (Spain)
** Monitoring Agricultural ResourceS (MARS) project
** Restrictions for N and P in agriculture
** Calculation threshold trace elements
** Use of Soil Scape Viewer
** Establishment Less Favoured Areas (France)
* *Contaminated sites*
** Contaminated Land Register Austria
** Use Case drinking water and soil contamination
** Use Case Ecology and contamination
** Use Case Property and contamination
* *Soil Monitoring*
** Use Case state of soil in Europe

To show the relevance of known European legislation related to soil, the Use Cases were cross-checked with the legislation at hand; where there is a common interest or overlap on data used, it is indicated in the following table:

image::./media/table_page_12.png[image,width=802,height=943, align=center]

NOTE none of the directives is considered as a use case in itself.

Based on the mentioned Use Cases and on the TWG-SO expertise, the following relevant and general uses for soil information were identified:

* For using the spatial distribution of soils and their properties, data that allow the creation of maps (at various scales) on the distribution of soil types and soil properties are needed. Such data are based on data taken from soil profiles, soil observations and soil samples (taken on soil sites at soil plots), which in combination with human expertise and/or automated procedures can be interpreted such that physical real world areas, which show certain soil characteristics, can be delineated, depending on the scale considered, and named here as soil bodies. Hence structuring soil data and the possibility for mapping them are included.
* Over time, important soil characteristics (e.g. content of organic carbon, soil acidity, etc.) may vary, and it can be required to follow these changes over time. Hence real world 'soil monitoring' is taken into consideration.
* In the context of the EU Soil Thematic Strategy, soil contamination is considered as one of the major threats to soil, at the local scale (contaminated sites); at large area scale (diffuse soil contamination, usually low level and dispersed by deposition from air, by groundwater or by agricultural practices) and at the level of brownfields (regions with many contaminated sites and usually combined with diffuse contamination). An attempt is made to include a generic approach towards some aspects of soil contamination (see Annex D).

The INSPIRE themes _Soil_ and Geology show some overlap regarding the real world objects they describe, but often see them under different perspectives (*Figure 1*). For the soil domain, rock is the parent material of any soil development, and as such geogenic layers are included in soil datasets. Nonetheless, rock types and their genesis can be named in the same way as in the domain of geology. Hence, the code lists to characterize lithology, processes and process environments have been agreed upon by the INSPIRE Thematic Working Groups Geology and _Soil_. As the superficial layers in which soils develop are not considered in geological datasets throughout, the spatial data from both domains do not necessarily overlap, but kind of complete one another.

*Figure 1: The field of Pedology seen in relation to the field of Geology.*

On the basis of the previous considerations, the soil theme includes the following phenomena (either in the physical world or conceptualized world):

* soil profiles
* soil sites, soil plots
* soil bodies (delineated areas on the earth's surface determined on the basis of certain soil characteristics)
* soil characteristics (parameters) that change over time (possibly allowing soil monitoring)

Considering these soil related phenomena, an object model is constructed in the form of a UML class diagram. Information exchange structured according to this model, originating from different providers, will be structurally interoperable and provide a possible way for meaningful exchange of soil information.

A model was developed consisting of a core of objects, their interrelations and attributes; they are considered to be essential; this model is the basis for further INSPIRE legislation.

However, as exemplified by some of the described Use Cases, the objects of the model do not fully allow for the implementation of certain uses and purposes. The need for modelling of soil data beyond this model is accommodated by the possibility of creating extensions to it. In this document, the implementation of a kind of extension is demonstrated for a Use Case on soil contamination and content of soil organic carbon (see Annex D).

In the following, the structuring of the elements and concepts of the soil domain as model-objects and attributes is described. It should be noted that many elements of the European Soil Geographical Data Base and other international initiatives related to the standardization and exchange of soil data have been taken into account. The names given to the objects, attributes and associations are as neutral as possible i.e. not deliberately taken from existing, specific nomenclature.
