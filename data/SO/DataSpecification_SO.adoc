== *How to read the document?*

This document describes the _"INSPIRE data specification on Soil – Technical Guidelines"_ version 3.0 as developed by the Thematic Working Group (TWG) _TWG-Soil_ using both natural and a conceptual schema language.

The data specification is based on a common templatefootnote:[The common document template is available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2] used for all data specifications, which has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I, II and III data specifications.

This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the Implementing Rule for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. It also includes additional requirements and recommendations that, although not included in the Implementing Rule, are relevant to guarantee or to increase data interoperability.

Two executive summaries provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on _Soil_ in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first.

The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of _Soil_, but also to other stakeholders and users of the spatial data infrastructure.

The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes.

In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the spatial object types, the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in _italics._

== *Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services – General Executive Summary*

The challenges regarding the lack of availability, quality, organisation, accessibility, and sharing of spatial information are common to a large number of policies and activities and are experienced across the various levels of public authority in Europe. In order to solve these problems it is necessary to take measures of coordination between the users and providers of spatial information. The Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council adopted on 14 March 2007 aims at establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) for environmental policies, or policies and activities that have an impact on the environment.

INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created and maintained by the Member States. To support the establishment of a European infrastructure, Implementing Rules addressing the following components of the infrastructure have been specified: metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets (as described in Annexes I, II, III of the Directive) and spatial data services, network services, data and service sharing, and monitoring and reporting procedures.

INSPIRE does not require collection of new data. However, after the period specified in the Directivefootnote:[For all 34 Annex I,II and III data themes: within two years of the adoption of the corresponding Implementing Rules for newly collected and extensively restructured data and within 5 years for other data in electronic format still in use] Member States have to make their data available according to the Implementing Rules.

Interoperability in INSPIRE means the possibility to combine spatial data and services from different sources across the European Community in a consistent way without involving specific efforts of humans or machines. It is important to note that "interoperability" is understood as providing access to spatial data sets through network services, typically via Internet. Interoperability may be achieved by either changing (harmonising) and storing existing data sets or transforming them via services for publication in the INSPIRE infrastructure. It is expected that users will spend less time and efforts on understanding and integrating data when they build their applications based on data delivered in accordance with INSPIRE.

In order to benefit from the endeavours of international standardisation bodies and organisations established under international law their standards and technical means have been utilised and referenced, whenever possible.

To facilitate the implementation of INSPIRE, it is important that all stakeholders have the opportunity to participate in specification and development. For this reason, the Commission has put in place a consensus building process involving data users, and providers together with representatives of industry, research and government. These stakeholders, organised through Spatial Data Interest Communities (SDIC) and Legally Mandated Organisations (LMO)footnote:[The current status of registered SDICs/LMOs is available via INSPIRE website: http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/42], have provided reference materials, participated in the user requirement and technicalfootnote:[Surveys on unique identifiers and usage of the elements of the spatial and temporal schema,] surveys, proposed experts for the Data Specification Drafting Teamfootnote:[The Data Specification Drafting Team has been composed of experts from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, UK, and the European Environment Agency], the Thematic Working Groupsfootnote:[The Thematic Working Groups have been composed of experts from Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, the European Environment Agency and the European Commission.] and other ad-hoc cross-thematic technical groups and participated in the public stakeholder consultations on draft versions of the data specifications. These consultations covered expert reviews as well as feasibility and fitness-for-purpose testing of the data specificationsfootnote:[For Annex IIIII, the consultation and testing phase lasted from 20 June to 21 October 2011.].

This open and participatory approach was successfully used during the development of the data specifications on Annex I, II and III data themes as well as during the preparation of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:323:SOM:EN:HTML[implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services,] published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 8^th^ of December 2010.] for Annex I spatial data themes and of its amendment regarding the themes of Annex II and III.

The development framework elaborated by the Data Specification Drafting Team aims at keeping the data specifications of the different themes coherent. It summarises the methodology to be used for the development of the data specifications, providing a coherent set of requirements and recommendations to achieve interoperability. The pillars of the framework are the following technical documentsfootnote:[The framework documents are available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2]:

* The _Definition of Annex Themes and Scope_ describes in greater detail the spatial data themes defined in the Directive, and thus provides a sound starting point for the thematic aspects of the data specification development.
* The _Generic Conceptual Model_ defines the elements necessary for interoperability and data harmonisation including cross-theme issues. It specifies requirements and recommendations with regard to data specification elements of common use, like the spatial and temporal schema, unique identifier management, object referencing, some common code lists, etc. Those requirements of the Generic Conceptual Model that are directly implementable are included in the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services.
* The _Methodology for the Development of Data Specifications_ defines a repeatable methodology. It describes how to arrive from user requirements to a data specification through a number of steps including use-case development, initial specification development and analysis of analogies and gaps for further specification refinement.
* The _Guidelines for the Encoding of Spatial Data_ defines how geographic information can be encoded to enable transfer processes between the systems of the data providers in the Member States. Even though it does not specify a mandatory encoding rule it sets GML (ISO 19136) as the default encoding for INSPIRE.
* The _Guidelines for the use of Observations & Measurements and Sensor Web Enablement-related standards in INSPIRE Annex II and III data specification development_ provides guidelines on how the "Observations and Measurements" standard (ISO 19156) is to be used within INSPIRE.
* The _Common data models_ are a set of documents that specify data models that are referenced by a number of different data specifications. These documents include generic data models for networks, coverages and activity complexes.

The structure of the data specifications is based on the "ISO 19131 Geographic information - Data product specifications" standard. They include the technical documentation of the application schema, the spatial object types with their properties, and other specifics of the spatial data themes using natural language as well as a formal conceptual schema languagefootnote:[UML – Unified Modelling Language].

A consolidated model repository, feature concept dictionary, and glossary are being maintained to support the consistent specification development and potential further reuse of specification elements. The consolidated model consists of the harmonised models of the relevant standards from the ISO 19100 series, the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model, and the application schemasfootnote:[Conceptual models related to specific areas (e.g. INSPIRE themes)] developed for each spatial data theme. The multilingual INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary contains the definition and description of the INSPIRE themes together with the definition of the spatial object types present in the specification. The INSPIRE Glossary defines all the terms (beyond the spatial object types) necessary for understanding the INSPIRE documentation including the terminology of other components (metadata, network services, data sharing, and monitoring).

By listing a number of requirements and making the necessary recommendations, the data specifications enable full system interoperability across the Member States, within the scope of the application areas targeted by the Directive. The data specifications (in their version 3.0) are published as technical guidelines and provide the basis for the content of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[In the case of the Annex IIIII data specifications, the extracted requirements are used to formulate an amendment to the existing Implementing Rule.]. The content of the Implementing Rule is extracted from the data specifications, considering short- and medium-term feasibility as well as cost-benefit considerations. The requirements included in the Implementing Rule are legally binding for the Member States according to the timeline specified in the INSPIRE Directive.

In addition to providing a basis for the interoperability of spatial data in INSPIRE, the data specification development framework and the thematic data specifications can be reused in other environments at local, regional, national and global level contributing to improvements in the coherence and interoperability of data in spatial data infrastructures.

== *_Soil_ – Executive Summary*

For the purpose of the data specification in this document, soil is the upper part of the earth's crust, formed by mineral particles, organic matter, water, air and living organisms. It is the interface between rock, air and water which hosts most of the biosphere. Soil is subject to a series of threats as recognized not only in the EU Soil Thematic Strategy (COM(2006)231 final), but indirectly also in several adopted EU Directives (e.g. 1999/31/EC, 91/676/EEC, 86/278/EC..). The requirements of these directives were considered while compiling this data specification.

Based on the definition given by the Directive (2007/2/EC), the scope for the soil theme covers:

[loweralpha]
. *Soil inventories*, providing one-off assessments of soil conditions and/or soil properties at certain locations and at a specific point in time, and allow soil monitoring, providing a series of assessments showing how soil conditions and/or properties change over time.
. *Soil mapping*, providing a spatial presentation of the properties linked to the soils, including soil types; typically, soil maps are derived with the help of data available in soil inventories. Also other soil related information derived from soil properties, possibly in combination with non-soil data are within the scope.

The INSPIRE methodology was used (D2.6). The input from the Member States was used for defining 15 Use cases covering Agro-Environmental Indicators, Soil Derived Information, Contaminated sites and Soil Monitoring (see Annex B). Based on these Use cases, together with the expert knowledge present in the thematic working group (TWG), the data model was built and validated.

The comments from the Member State consultation and the testing were used to improve the data model.

The data model contains a core set of spatial object types and their attributes that are considered to be essential for the infrastructure along which data on soil can be exchanged. In addition to the core _Soil_ data model an extension data model (including application schema) deals with the management of soil contamination (see Annex D). This model extension demonstrates how the core _Soil_ data model can be extended to include more specific requirements (soil contamination) that were identified by the Use cases.

The TWG has also prepared an example of how a soil derived theme - soil organic carbon - can be provided utilising the core _Soil_ data model. (see Annex D)

The soil observable parameters relevant for some approved EU Directives are included in the model in the spatial object types SoilProfile, ProfileElement, SoilDerivedObject and SoilThemeCoverage.

The data specification is based, as far as possible, on existing standards. Apart from general ISO19xxx standards used in relation to geographical information, use was also made of the ISO DIS 28258 (Draft International Standard/Soil Quality) standard. As soil contains many observable and measurable parameters, the specialised use of the ISO 19156:2011 Observations and Measurements standard is proposed. Based on the soil community practise to provide thematic soil map information in a raster form, this option is provided for by utilising the ISO 19123 Coverages standard.

To enhance semantic interoperability the use of the soil classification scheme WRB (World Reference Base for Soil Resources) and the FAO horizon notation scheme as primary classification systems are proposed. The use of other currently used (local, regional, national) classification systems is also provided for.

== Scope

This document specifies a harmonised data specification for the spatial data theme _Soil_ as defined in Annex III of the INSPIRE Directive.

This data specification provides the basis for the drafting of Implementing Rules according to Article 7 (1) of the INSPIRE Directive [Directive 2007/2/EC]. The entire data specification is published as implementation guidelines accompanying these Implementing Rules.

== Overview

=== Name

INSPIRE data specification for the theme _Soil_.

=== Informal description

*Definition:*

Soils and subsoil characterised according to depth, texture, structure and content of particles and organic material, stoniness, erosion, where appropriate mean slope and anticipated water storage capacity. [Directive 2007/2/EC]

*Description:*

Soil is a non-renewable resource at the human scale, which is important for many parts of society. In many places in the world, soil degradation is a serious process threatening that soil can fulfil its functions in the future. In the climate change debate, soil is becoming important in relation to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Soil degradation may result in soils that no longer can fulfil services like food production, or being so contaminated that they form a threat for human and/or ecological health.

Soil is subject to a series of threats as recognized in the EU Soil Thematic Strategy (COM(2006)231 final): erosion, organic matter decline, contamination, salinisation, sodification, compaction, soil biodiversity loss, sealing, landslides and flooding. Also soil acidification is generally considered to be a problem in humid areas. Information on soils is crucial to make fundamental decisions and to protect the soil against degradation processes.

The need for soil information can vary from improvement of agricultural and forestry production, prevention of environment damage due to human activities, or to getting to know the location and extent of sites with high concentrations of harmful substances. There is a high demand for soil information in relation to carbon sequestration (climate change), the prevention of soil degradation, improvement of agricultural production (e.g. food and bio-energy crops) and for the mitigation of desertification in areas with arid and semi-arid climatic conditions.

In order to provide meaningful use and to share and exchange information in the field of soil, part of the world of soil (seen as a Universe of Discourse (UoD)) is to be modelled. The soil UoD is defined and limited by the problems that need to be solved and the solutions that are to be provided through the use of soil information. The kind of soil information is suggested by Use Cases (preferably underpinned by legislation) that have been identified by the TWG-SO based on input from INSPIRE stakeholders and by the expertise available in the expert group.

The following use cases are identified and described in Annex B:

* *Agri-Environmental Indicators:*
** Use Case Environmental Indicator Soil Erosion
** Use Case Environmental Indicator Soil Quality
** Use Case Environmental Indicator Contaminated Sites
* *Thematic maps derived from soil information*
** Land irrigation suitability in Navarra (Spain)
** Development of methodologies for soil salinity surveillance in the middle Ebro basin (Spain)
** Monitoring Agricultural ResourceS (MARS) project
** Restrictions for N and P in agriculture
** Calculation threshold trace elements
** Use of Soil Scape Viewer
** Establishment Less Favoured Areas (France)
* *Contaminated sites*
** Contaminated Land Register Austria
** Use Case drinking water and soil contamination
** Use Case Ecology and contamination
** Use Case Property and contamination
* *Soil Monitoring*
** Use Case state of soil in Europe

To show the relevance of known European legislation related to soil, the Use Cases were cross-checked with the legislation at hand; where there is a common interest or overlap on data used, it is indicated in the following table:

image::./media/table_page_12.png[image,width=802,height=943, align=center]

NOTE none of the directives is considered as a use case in itself.

Based on the mentioned Use Cases and on the TWG-SO expertise, the following relevant and general uses for soil information were identified:

* For using the spatial distribution of soils and their properties, data that allow the creation of maps (at various scales) on the distribution of soil types and soil properties are needed. Such data are based on data taken from soil profiles, soil observations and soil samples (taken on soil sites at soil plots), which in combination with human expertise and/or automated procedures can be interpreted such that physical real world areas, which show certain soil characteristics, can be delineated, depending on the scale considered, and named here as soil bodies. Hence structuring soil data and the possibility for mapping them are included.
* Over time, important soil characteristics (e.g. content of organic carbon, soil acidity, etc.) may vary, and it can be required to follow these changes over time. Hence real world 'soil monitoring' is taken into consideration.
* In the context of the EU Soil Thematic Strategy, soil contamination is considered as one of the major threats to soil, at the local scale (contaminated sites); at large area scale (diffuse soil contamination, usually low level and dispersed by deposition from air, by groundwater or by agricultural practices) and at the level of brownfields (regions with many contaminated sites and usually combined with diffuse contamination). An attempt is made to include a generic approach towards some aspects of soil contamination (see Annex D).

The INSPIRE themes _Soil_ and Geology show some overlap regarding the real world objects they describe, but often see them under different perspectives (*Figure 1*). For the soil domain, rock is the parent material of any soil development, and as such geogenic layers are included in soil datasets. Nonetheless, rock types and their genesis can be named in the same way as in the domain of geology. Hence, the code lists to characterize lithology, processes and process environments have been agreed upon by the INSPIRE Thematic Working Groups Geology and _Soil_. As the superficial layers in which soils develop are not considered in geological datasets throughout, the spatial data from both domains do not necessarily overlap, but kind of complete one another.

[.text-center]
*Figure 1: The field of Pedology seen in relation to the field of Geology.*

On the basis of the previous considerations, the soil theme includes the following phenomena (either in the physical world or conceptualized world):

* soil profiles
* soil sites, soil plots
* soil bodies (delineated areas on the earth's surface determined on the basis of certain soil characteristics)
* soil characteristics (parameters) that change over time (possibly allowing soil monitoring)

Considering these soil related phenomena, an object model is constructed in the form of a UML class diagram. Information exchange structured according to this model, originating from different providers, will be structurally interoperable and provide a possible way for meaningful exchange of soil information.

A model was developed consisting of a core of objects, their interrelations and attributes; they are considered to be essential; this model is the basis for further INSPIRE legislation.

However, as exemplified by some of the described Use Cases, the objects of the model do not fully allow for the implementation of certain uses and purposes. The need for modelling of soil data beyond this model is accommodated by the possibility of creating extensions to it. In this document, the implementation of a kind of extension is demonstrated for a Use Case on soil contamination and content of soil organic carbon (see Annex D).

In the following, the structuring of the elements and concepts of the soil domain as model-objects and attributes is described. It should be noted that many elements of the European Soil Geographical Data Base and other international initiatives related to the standardization and exchange of soil data have been taken into account. The names given to the objects, attributes and associations are as neutral as possible i.e. not deliberately taken from existing, specific nomenclature.

[.text-center]
*Figure 2: Soil profile layer and horizon located in a soil plot.*

*Soil Profiles*

The real world concept "soil profile" (*_SoilProfile_* class in the model) (illustrated by *Figure 2*) can be defined as a cross-section of the soil from the surface down to and including the beginning of the fresh material unmodified by pedogenesis, consisting of various more or less horizontally oriented features formed by pedogenic processes called horizons. Any real world soil profile, considered as a whole, can be characterized by a number of properties, such as: its soil type according to a soil classification scheme, its water capacity available for plants, coarse fragment cover, the presence of a water table, etc. Soil horizons within a profile possess biological, physical and chemical characteristics which differ from the horizons above and beneath and are distinguished principally by texture, colour, structure, chemical composition, and their biomass. The chemical properties may include concentrations in the solid, water and air phases, mobility and soil adsorption capacities. A profile can additionally be described with layers (instead of being described with horizons) which do not necessarily correspond with pedo-genetically formed horizons. Such layers can be fixed depths intervals of sampling, top- and subsoil, or geogenic layers. Layers and horizons are considered both as profile elements in the model as they are both horizontal subdivisions of the soil profile.

The real world concept "observed soil profile" (*_ObservedSoilProfile_* object in the model) represents a soil profile *physically* located in a soil plot (or exposed with a boring), described in the field, possibly sampled and analysed in the laboratory. An observed soil profile refers to a real world location (specified by an associated soil plot).

image::./media/image6.png[image,width=468,height=370, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 3: Soil profiles, soil bodies.*

A "derived soil profile" (*_DerivedSoilProfile_* object in the model) is a soil profile that cannot be located in a soil plot. It corresponds to the spatial extent of a soil type that has been observed in one or several observed soil profiles. The derived soil profile has property values that could be derived (e.g. averaged) from the values of the corresponding properties of one or more observed soil profiles. The derived soil profile can be characterized by the same properties as those of the observed soil profiles, but it is understood that the values for these properties have been derived or determined by expert judgment or calculation. A derived soil profile can be seen as a characterisation of a Soil Typological Unit (STU), or Series, as recognized in the European Soil Geographical Database and other soil databases at national or regional levels. A derived soil profile is not necessarily linked to observed soil profiles, in which case it represents a hypothetical soil profile.

*Soil delineated areas*

To delineate spatially an area that is characterized by a set of such derived soil profiles, the model introduces the construct of "soil body" (*_SoilBody_* object in the model) which represents an association (or other types of spatial interlinkages of various soil types) of soils that are found together in the area. Soils forming the soil body are described using derived soil profiles. The soil body can be represented by one or more derived soil profiles, giving an impression of the properties of the soil body as a whole. This is modelled by linking derived soil profiles to the soil body, indicating their area share, expressed in percentages or percentage ranges (see *Figure 3*). Note that the exact location of each kind of soil type within the soil body is unknown; only the area (geometry) of the soil body is known and also how much of this area is covered by each of the soil types (described as derived soil profiles) in that area. For instance, a soil body could consist of one dominant soil (as described by a derived soil profile) and of other soils (described by other derived soil profiles) having characteristics different from the dominant one. The label of a soil body allows a description of it, which may be useful for building legends. A soil body can be interpreted as a Soil Mapping Unit (SMU) as recognized in the European Soil Geographical Data Base and other soil databases at national or regional levels.

In the context of the model, a *_SoilDerivedObject_* object is defined as a spatial object representing a soil related property which value could, for instance, be derived from values of soil properties of related observed soil profiles and/or related soil bodies (and thus soil derived profiles). A value completely independent of observed soil profiles and soil bodies could be possible as well.

In practice, the derivation of values for the _SoilDerivedObject_ objects could be done from information stored in observed soil profiles and/or soil bodies, or it could also be done from such information in combination with external data. An example of the former could be the calculation of pH or soil organic matter content in the topsoil, based on data found in a set of observed soil profiles. An example of the latter could be the derivation of certain soil related properties (for example soil erosion risk) for which calibrated models are to be used which not only extract and elaborate information from observed soil profiles and/or soil bodies, but also require data that are external to the soil Model (e.g. meteorological and land cover data).

In Annex D an example is given how the model can be extended for a more concrete use case (soil organic carbon content and soil organic carbon stock), both as a coverage and as a vector.

*Soil Site and Soil Plot*

A soil site (*_SoilSite_* object in the model) is considered as a) the surrounding of a soil profile, and/or b) the larger piece of land that is directly linked to and described by all soil investigations on one or more spots, called soil plots. A "soil plot" (*_SoilPlot_* object in the model) is the location of a specific soil investigation (e.g. of a trial pit). Because for many soil investigations the studied soil is destroyed, the soil site provides also the object to which the results of repeated investigations are related and handled as if they were obtained from the very same place. The purpose of the investigation can be of a general nature (e.g. a reconnaissance whereby soil profiles are taken for a general soil characterization) or specific (e.g. a reconnaissance whereby samples are taken to investigate potentially contaminated land); this information can be crucial for data evaluation to identify bias in the selection of sites. A soil plot within a soil site is of a certain type (borehole, trial pit, sample) and located by coordinates and/or the name of that location.

*Soil characteristics that change over time*

There are no explicit constructs foreseen related to soil monitoring. Monitoring, considered as the repeated observation of one or more soil characteristics over time, can be implemented through the use of the various time/date attributes of the objects of the model.

*Soil Contamination*

There are no explicit constructs for soil contamination data in the Model. Contamination is implicitly included by the possibility of specifying contamination parameters for sites, profiles and profile elements. The contaminants are treated here like chemical elements. There are also no explicit constructs included in the model for contaminated sites. For the moment, *as an example* how the model could be extended to deal with soil contaminated sites and site management, a generic Use Case on "Soil – Contamination" is provided in Annex D. Nevertheless, some heavy metal elements are part of a codelist for profile element parameter because they are cited by the directive 86/278/EC as elements to be analysed in agricultural parcels before the application of sewage sludge.

*Note on soil sampling*

In the context of soils two different meanings can be seen for "sample":

On the one hand, the notion of "soil sample", considered as a physical part of the soil for which one or more properties are determined. This notion is not withheld as an explicit construct in the Model.

On the other hand, "sample" is considered to be the location where soil material is taken at a specific depth or over a depth range without doing any soil profile description. "Sample", together with trial pit and borehole, is a type of soil plot. The latter is the concept described in the model.

{empty}NOTE: The ISO DIS 28258 draft standard has been developed in parallel with this data specification on soil. It has a wider scope, but the models mutually influenced each other. In conclusion, as far as both models cover the same real world objects, central terms and definitions in and for the data models are near enough to be mappable into each other.

=== Terms and definitions

General terms and definitions helpful for understanding the INSPIRE data specification documents are defined in the INSPIRE Glossaryfootnote:[The INSPIRE Glossary is available from http://inspire-registry.jrc.ec.europa.eu/registers/GLOSSARY].

Specifically, for the theme _Soil_, the following terms are defined:

*_Soil Body:_* Part of the soil cover that is delineated and that is homogeneous with regard to certain soil properties and/or spatial patterns. It is the real-world correlate of a *_soil mapping unit_*.

*_Derived Soil Profile:_* A non-point-located soil profile that serves as a reference profile for a specific soil type in a certain geographical area. One or more derived soil profiles can represent the information which is combined to so-called *_Soil Typological Units_* (STUs) in some soil mapping approaches.

*_Soil Derived Object_*: A spatial object type for representing spatial objects with soil-related property derived from one or more soil and possibly other non soil properties. It is the real-world correlate of the mapping units of soil property maps which often are derived from the soil map that shows the distribution of soil taxa.

=== How the Technical Guidelines map to the Implementing Rules

The schematic diagram in Figure 4 gives an overview of the relationships between the INSPIRE legal acts (the INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules) and the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines. The INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules include legally binding requirements that describe, usually on an abstract level, _what_ Member States must implement.

In contrast, the Technical Guidelines define _how_ Member States might implement the requirements included in the INSPIRE Implementing Rules. As such, they may include non-binding technical requirements that must be satisfied if a Member State data provider chooses to conform to the Technical Guidelines. Implementing these Technical Guidelines will maximise the interoperability of INSPIRE spatial data sets.

*Figure 4 - Relationship between INSPIRE Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines*

==== Requirements

The purpose of these Technical Guidelines (Data specifications on _Soil_) is to provide practical guidance for implementation that is guided by, and satisfies, the (legally binding) requirements included for the spatial data theme _Soil_ in the Regulation (Implementing Rules) on interoperability of spatial data sets and services. These requirements are highlighted in this document as follows:

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article / Annex / Section no._
*Title / Heading*

This style is used for requirements contained in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).
====

For each of these IR requirements, these Technical Guidelines contain additional explanations and examples.

NOTE The Abstract Test Suite (ATS) in Annex A contains conformance tests that directly check conformance with these IR requirements.

Furthermore, these Technical Guidelines may propose a specific technical implementation for satisfying an IR requirement. In such cases, these Technical Guidelines may contain additional technical requirements that need to be met in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement _when using this proposed implementation_. These technical requirements are highlighted as follows:

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement X* This style is used for requirements for a specific technical solution proposed in these Technical Guidelines for an IR requirement.
====

NOTE 1 Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in the ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

NOTE 2 In addition to the requirements included in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services, the INSPIRE Directive includes further legally binding obligations that put additional requirements on data providers. For example, Art. 10(2) requires that Member States shall, where appropriate, decide by mutual consent on the depiction and position of geographical features whose location spans the frontier between two or more Member States. General guidance for how to meet these obligations is provided in the INSPIRE framework documents.

==== Recommendations

In addition to IR and TG requirements, these Technical Guidelines may also include a number of recommendations for facilitating implementation or for further and coherent development of an interoperable infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation X* Recommendations are shown using this style.
====

NOTE The implementation of recommendations is not mandatory. Compliance with these Technical Guidelines or the legal obligation does not depend on the fulfilment of the recommendations.

==== Conformance

Annex A includes the abstract test suite for checking conformance with the requirements included in these Technical Guidelines and the corresponding parts of the Implementing Rules (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).

<<<
== Specification scopes

This data specification does not distinguish different specification scopes, but just considers one general scope.

NOTE For more information on specification scopes, see [ISO 19131:2007], clause 8 and Annex D.

== Identification information

These Technical Guidelines are identified by the following URI:
http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/tg/so/3.0

NOTE ISO 19131 suggests further identification information to be included in this section, e.g. the title, abstract or spatial representation type. The proposed items are already described in the document metadata, executive summary, overview description (section 2) and descriptions of the application schemas (section 5). In order to avoid redundancy, they are not repeated here.

<<<
== Data content and structure

=== Application schemas – Overview 

==== Application schemas included in the IRs

Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the Implementing Rules lay down the requirements for the content and structure of the data sets related to the INSPIRE Annex themes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 4
*Types for the Exchange and Classification of Spatial Objects*

1. For the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets meeting the conditions laid down in Article 4 of Directive 2007/2/EC, Member States shall use the spatial object types and associated data types, enumerations and code lists that are defined in Annexes II, III and IV for the themes the data sets relate to.

2. Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in the Annexes.

3. The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types shall comply with the definitions and include the values set out in Annex II. The enumeration and code list values are uniquely identified by language-neutral mnemonic codes for computers. The values may also include a language-specific name to be used for human interaction.

====

The types to be used for the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets related to the spatial data theme _Soil_ are defined in the following application schema (see section 5.3):

*- Soil* - Soil application schema contains the essential elements of a data model that allow the exchange of geo-referenced soil data.

The application schemas specify requirements on the properties of each spatial object including its multiplicity, domain of valid values, constraints, etc.

NOTE The application schemas presented in this section contain some additional information that is not included in the Implementing Rules, in particular multiplicities of attributes and association roles.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 1*

Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the multiplicities defined for the attributes and association roles in this section.

====

An application schema may include references (e.g. in attributes or inheritance relationships) to common types or types defined in other spatial data themes. These types can be found in a sub-section called "Imported Types" at the end of each application schema section. The common types referred to from application schemas included in the IRs are addressed in Article 3.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 3_
*Common Types*

Types that are common to several of the themes listed in Annexes I, II and III to Directive 2007/2/EC shall conform to the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in Annex I.

====

NOTE Since the IRs contain the types for all INSPIRE spatial data themes in one document, Article 3 does not explicitly refer to types defined in other spatial data themes, but only to types defined in external data models.

Common types are described in detail in the Generic Conceptual Model [DS-D2.7], in the relevant international standards (e.g. of the ISO 19100 series) or in the documents on the common INSPIRE models [DS-D2.10.x]. For detailed descriptions of types defined in other spatial data themes, see the corresponding Data Specification TG document [DS-D2.8.x].

==== Additional recommended application schemas 

In addition to the application schemas listed above, the following additional application schemas have been defined for the theme _Soil_ (see Annex D)

*- Soil Contamination* – SoilContamination application schema demonstrates the extensibility of the core (legally mandated) SOIL data model to the field of the management of soil contaminated land.

These additional application schemas are not included in the IRs. They typically address requirements from specific (groups of) use cases and/or may be used to provide additional information. They are included in this specification in order to improve interoperability also for these additional aspects and to illustrate the extensibility of the application schemas included in the IRs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 1*

Additional and/or use case-specific information related to the theme _Soil_ should be made available using the spatial object types and data types specified in the following application schema(s): SoilContamination,

These spatial object types and data types should comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles defined in the Annex D.

The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types should comply with the definitions and include the values defined in the Annex D.

====

=== Basic notions

This section explains some of the basic notions used in the INSPIRE application schemas. These explanations are based on the GCM [DS-D2.5].

==== Notation

===== Unified Modeling Language (UML)

The application schemas included in this section are specified in UML, version 2.1. The spatial object types, their properties and associated types are shown in UML class diagrams.

NOTE For an overview of the UML notation, see Annex D in [ISO 19103].

The use of a common conceptual schema language (i.e. UML) allows for an automated processing of application schemas and the encoding, querying and updating of data based on the application schema – across different themes and different levels of detail.

The following important rules related to class inheritance and abstract classes are included in the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 5
*Types*

(...)

2. Types that are a sub-type of another type shall also include all this type's attributes and association roles.

3. Abstract types shall not be instantiated.

====

The use of UML conforms to ISO 19109 8.3 and ISO/TS 19103 with the exception that UML 2.1 instead of ISO/IEC 19501 is being used. The use of UML also conforms to ISO 19136 E.2.1.1.1-E.2.1.1.4.

NOTE ISO/TS 19103 and ISO 19109 specify a profile of UML to be used in conjunction with the ISO 19100 series. This includes in particular a list of stereotypes and basic types to be used in application schemas. ISO 19136 specifies a more restricted UML profile that allows for a direct encoding in XML Schema for data transfer purposes.

To model constraints on the spatial object types and their properties, in particular to express data/data set consistency rules, OCL (Object Constraint Language) is used as described in ISO/TS 19103, whenever possible. In addition, all constraints are described in the feature catalogue in English, too.

NOTE Since "void" is not a concept supported by OCL, OCL constraints cannot include expressions to test whether a value is a _void_ value. Such constraints may only be expressed in natural language.

===== Stereotypes

In the application schemas in this section several stereotypes are used that have been defined as part of a UML profile for use in INSPIRE [DS-D2.5]. These are explained in Table 1 below.

[.text-center]
*Table 1 – Stereotypes (adapted from [DS-D2.5])*

[align=center,width="100%",cols="22%,14%,64%"]
|===
|*Stereotype* |*Model element* |*Description*
|applicationSchema |Package |An INSPIRE application schema according to ISO 19109 and the Generic Conceptual Model.
|leaf |Package |A package that is not an application schema and contains no packages.
|featureType |Class |A spatial object type.
|type |Class |A type that is not directly instantiable, but is used as an abstract collection of operation, attribute and relation signatures. This stereotype should usually not be used in INSPIRE application schemas as these are on a different conceptual level than classifiers with this stereotype.
|dataType |Class |A structured data type without identity.
|union |Class |A structured data type without identity where exactly one of the properties of the type is present in any instance.
|enumeration |Class |An enumeration.
|codeList |Class |A code list.
|import |Dependency |The model elements of the supplier package are imported.
|voidable |Attribute, association role |A voidable attribute or association role (see section 5.2.2).
|lifeCycleInfo |Attribute, association role |If in an application schema a property is considered to be part of the life-cycle information of a spatial object type, the property shall receive this stereotype.
|version |Association role |If in an application schema an association role ends at a spatial object type, this stereotype denotes that the value of the property is meant to be a specific version of the spatial object, not the spatial object in general.
|===

==== Voidable characteristics

The «voidable» stereotype is used to characterise those properties of a spatial object that may not be present in some spatial data sets, even though they may be present or applicable in the real world. This does _not_ mean that it is optional to provide a value for those properties.

For all properties defined for a spatial object, a value has to be provided – either the corresponding value (if available in the data set maintained by the data provider) or the value of _void._ A _void_ value shall imply that no corresponding value is contained in the source spatial data set maintained by the data provider or no corresponding value can be derived from existing values at reasonable costs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 2*

The reason for a _void_ value should be provided where possible using a listed value from the VoidReasonValue code list to indicate the reason for the missing value.

====

The VoidReasonValue type is a code list, which includes the following pre-defined values:

* _Unpopulated_: The property is not part of the dataset maintained by the data provider. However, the characteristic may exist in the real world. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" has not been included in a dataset containing lake spatial objects, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unpopulated'. The property receives this value for all spatial objects in the spatial data set.
* _Unknown_: The correct value for the specific spatial object is not known to, and not computable by the data provider. However, a correct value may exist. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" _of a certain lake_ has not been measured, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unknown'. This value is applied only to those spatial objects where the property in question is not known.
* _Withheld_: The characteristic may exist, but is confidential and not divulged by the data provider.

NOTE It is possible that additional reasons will be identified in the future, in particular to support reasons / special values in coverage ranges.

The «voidable» stereotype does not give any information on whether or not a characteristic exists in the real world. This is expressed using the multiplicity:

* If a characteristic may or may not exist in the real world, its minimum cardinality shall be defined as 0. For example, if an Address may or may not have a house number, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 0..1.
* If at least one value for a certain characteristic exists in the real world, the minimum cardinality shall be defined as 1. For example, if an Administrative Unit always has at least one name, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 1..*.

In both cases, the «voidable» stereotype can be applied. In cases where the minimum multiplicity is 0, the absence of a value indicates that it is known that no value exists, whereas a value of void indicates that it is not known whether a value exists or not.

EXAMPLE If an address does not have a house number, the corresponding Address object should not have any value for the «voidable» attribute house number. If the house number is simply not known or not populated in the data set, the Address object should receive a value of _void_ (with the corresponding void reason) for the house number attribute.

==== Enumerations

Enumerations are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values are modelled as attributes of the enumeration class using the following modelling style:

* No initial value, but only the attribute name part, is used.
* The attribute name conforms to the rules for attributes names, i.e. is a lowerCamelCase name. Exceptions are words that consist of all uppercase letters (acronyms).

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 6
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

5) Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types that have an enumeration type may only take values from the lists specified for the enumeration type."

====

==== Code lists

Code lists are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values, however, are managed outside of the application schema.

===== Code list types

The IRs distinguish the following types of code lists.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 6
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

1) Code lists shall be of one of the following types, as specified in the Annexes:

.. code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in this Regulation;

.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and narrower values defined by data providers;

.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and additional values at any level defined by data providers;

.. code lists, whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers.

For the purposes of points (b), (c) and (d), in addition to the allowed values, data providers may use the values specified in the relevant INSPIRE Technical Guidance document available on the INSPIRE web site of the Joint Research Centre.

====

The type of code list is represented in the UML model through the tagged value _extensibility_, which can take the following values:

* _none_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in the IRs (type a);
* _narrower_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and narrower values defined by data providers (type b);
* _open_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and additional values at any level defined by data providers (type c); and
* _any_, representing code lists, for which the IRs do not specify any allowed values, i.e. whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers (type d).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 3*

Additional values defined by data providers should not replace or redefine any value already specified in the IRs.

====

NOTE This data specification may specify recommended values for some of the code lists of type (b), (c) and (d) (see section 5.2.4.3). These recommended values are specified in a dedicated Annex.

In addition, code lists can be hierarchical, as explained in Article 6(2) of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 6
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

2) Code lists may be hierarchical. Values of hierarchical code lists may have a more generic parent value. Where the valid values of a hierarchical code list are specified in a table in this Regulation, the parent values are listed in the last column.

====

The type of code list and whether it is hierarchical or not is also indicated in the feature catalogues.

===== Obligations on data providers

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 6
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(....)

3) Where, for an attribute whose type is a code list as referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of paragraph 1, a data provider provides a value that is not specified in this Regulation, that value and its definition shall be made available in a register.

4) Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types whose type is a code list may only take values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list.

====

Article 6(4) obliges data providers to use only values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list. The "allowed values according to the specification of the code list" are the values explicitly defined in the IRs plus (in the case of code lists of type (b), (c) and (d)) additional values defined by data providers.

For attributes whose type is a code list of type (b), (c) or (d) data providers may use additional values that are not defined in the IRs. Article 6(3) requires that such additional values and their definition be made available in a register. This enables users of the data to look up the meaning of the additional values used in a data set, and also facilitates the re-use of additional values by other data providers (potentially across Member States).

NOTE Guidelines for setting up registers for additional values and how to register additional values in these registers is still an open discussion point between Member States and the Commission.

===== Recommended code list values

For code lists of type (b), (c) and (d), this data specification may propose additional values as a recommendation (in a dedicated Annex). These values will be included in the INSPIRE code list register. This will facilitate and encourage the usage of the recommended values by data providers since the obligation to make additional values defined by data providers available in a register (see section 5.2.4.2) is already met.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 4*

Where these Technical Guidelines recommend values for a code list in addition to those specified in the IRs, these values should be used.

====

NOTE For some code lists of type (d), no values may be specified in these Technical Guidelines. In these cases, any additional value defined by data providers may be used.

===== Governance

The following two types of code lists are distinguished in INSPIRE:

* _Code lists that are governed by INSPIRE (INSPIRE-governed code lists)._ These code lists will be managed centrally in the INSPIRE code list register. Change requests to these code lists (e.g. to add, deprecate or supersede values) are processed and decided upon using the INSPIRE code list register's maintenance workflows. +
 +
INSPIRE-governed code lists will be made available in the INSPIRE code list register at __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>. They will be available in SKOS/RDF, XML and HTML. The maintenance will follow the procedures defined in ISO 19135. This means that the only allowed changes to a code list are the addition, deprecation or supersession of values, i.e. no value will ever be deleted, but only receive different statuses (valid, deprecated, superseded). Identifiers for values of INSPIRE-governed code lists are constructed using the pattern __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>/<value>.

* _Code lists that are governed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE (externally governed code lists)._ These code lists are managed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE, e.g. the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Change requests to these code lists follow the maintenance workflows defined by the maintaining organisations. Note that in some cases, no such workflows may be formally defined. +
 +
Since the updates of externally governed code lists is outside the control of INSPIRE, the IRs and these Technical Guidelines reference a specific version for such code lists. +
 +
The tables describing externally governed code lists in this section contain the following columns:
** The _Governance_ column describes the external organisation that is responsible for maintaining the code list.
** The _Source_ column specifies a citation for the authoritative source for the values of the code list. For code lists, whose values are mandated in the IRs, this citation should include the version of the code list used in INSPIRE. The version can be specified using a version number or the publication date. For code list values recommended in these Technical Guidelines, the citation may refer to the "latest available version".
** In some cases, for INSPIRE only a subset of an externally governed code list is relevant. The subset is specified using the _Subset_ column.
** The _Availability_ column specifies from where (e.g. URL) the values of the externally governed code list are available, and in which formats. Formats can include machine-readable (e.g. SKOS/RDF, XML) or human-readable (e.g. HTML, PDF) ones. +

Code list values are encoded using http URIs and labels. Rules for generating these URIs and labels are specified in a separate table.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 5*

The http URIs and labels used for encoding code list values should be taken from the INSPIRE code list registry for INSPIRE-governed code lists and generated according to the relevant rules specified for externally governed code lists.

====

NOTE Where practicable, the INSPIRE code list register could also provide http URIs and labels for externally governed code lists.

===== Vocabulary

For each code list, a tagged value called "vocabulary" is specified to define a URI identifying the values of the code list. For INSPIRE-governed code lists and externally governed code lists that do not have a persistent identifier, the URI is constructed following the pattern _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<UpperCamelCaseName_.

If the value is missing or empty, this indicates an empty code list. If no sub-classes are defined for this empty code list, this means that any code list may be used that meets the given definition.

An empty code list may also be used as a super-class for a number of specific code lists whose values may be used to specify the attribute value. If the sub-classes specified in the model represent all valid extensions to the empty code list, the subtyping relationship is qualified with the standard UML constraint "\{complete,disjoint}".

==== Identifier management

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 9_
*Identifier Management*

1. The data type Identifier defined in Section 2.1 of Annex I shall be used as a type for the external object identifier of a spatial object.

2. The external object identifier for the unique identification of spatial objects shall not be changed during the life-cycle of a spatial object.

====

NOTE 1 An external object identifier is a unique object identifier which is published by the responsible body, which may be used by external applications to reference the spatial object. [DS-D2.5]

NOTE 2 Article 9(1) is implemented in each application schema by including the attribute _inspireId_ of type Identifier.

NOTE 3 Article 9(2) is ensured if the _namespace_ and _localId_ attributes of the Identifier remains the same for different versions of a spatial object; the _version_ attribute can of course change.

*Other Requirements & Rules*

1. The value domain of spatial properties defined in this Regulation shall be restricted to the Simple Feature spatial schema as defined in Herring, John R. (ed.), OpenGIS® Implementation Standard for Geographic information – Simple feature access – Part 1: Common architecture, version 1.2.1, Open Geospatial Consortium, 2011, unless specified otherwise for a specific spatial data theme or type.

====

NOTE 1 The specification restricts the spatial schema to 0-, 1-, 2-, and 2.5-dimensional geometries where all curve interpolations are linear and surface interpolations are performed by triangles.

NOTE 2 The topological relations of two spatial objects based on their specific geometry and topology properties can in principle be investigated by invoking the operations of the types defined in ISO 19107 (or the methods specified in EN ISO 19125-1).

====  Temporality representation

The application schema(s) use(s) the derived attributes "beginLifespanVersion" and "endLifespanVersion" to record the lifespan of a spatial object.

The attributes "beginLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was inserted or changed in the spatial data set. The attribute "endLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was superseded or retired in the spatial data set.

NOTE 1 The attributes specify the beginning of the lifespan of the version in the spatial data set itself, which is different from the temporal characteristics of the real-world phenomenon described by the spatial object. This lifespan information, if available, supports mainly two requirements: First, knowledge about the spatial data set content at a specific time; second, knowledge about changes to a data set in a specific time frame. The lifespan information should be as detailed as in the data set (i.e., if the lifespan information in the data set includes seconds, the seconds should be represented in data published in INSPIRE) and include time zone information.

NOTE 2 Changes to the attribute "endLifespanVersion" does not trigger a change in the attribute "beginLifespanVersion".

===== Validity of the real-world phenomena

The application schema(s) use(s) the attributes "validFrom" and "validTo" to record the validity of the real-world phenomenon represented by a spatial object.

The attributes "validFrom" specifies the date and time at which the real-world phenomenon became valid in the real world. The attribute "validTo" specifies the date and time at which the real-world phenomenon is no longer valid in the real world.

Specific application schemas may give examples what "being valid" means for a specific real-world phenomenon represented by a spatial object.

==== Coverages

Coverage functions are used to describe characteristics of real-world phenomena that vary over space and/or time. Typical examples are temperature, elevation, precipitation, imagery. A coverage contains a set of such values, each associated with one of the elements in a spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal domain. Typical spatial domains are point sets (e.g. sensor locations), curve sets (e.g. isolines), grids (e.g. orthoimages, elevation models), etc.

In INSPIRE application schemas, coverage functions are defined as properties of spatial object types where the type of the property value is a realisation of one of the types specified in ISO 19123.

To improve alignment with coverage standards on the implementation level (e.g. ISO 19136 and the OGC Web Coverage Service) and to improve the cross-theme harmonisation on the use of coverages in INSPIRE, an application schema for coverage types is included in the Generic Conceptual Model in 9.9.4. This application schema contains the following coverage types:

* _RectifiedGridCoverage_: coverage whose domain consists of a rectified grid – a grid for which there is an affine transformation between the grid coordinates and the coordinates of a coordinate reference system (see Figure 5, left).
* _ReferenceableGridCoverage_: coverage whose domain consists of a referenceable grid – a grid associated with a transformation that can be used to convert grid coordinate values to values of coordinates referenced to a coordinate reference system (see Figure 5, right).

In addition, some themes make reference to the types TimeValuePair and Timeseries defined in Taylor, Peter (ed.), _OGC^®^ WaterML 2.0: Part 1 – Timeseries, v2.0.0,_ Open Geospatial Consortium, 2012. These provide a representation of the time instant/value pairs, i.e. time series (see Figure 6).

Where possible, only these coverage types (or a subtype thereof) are used in INSPIRE application schemas.

=== Application schema SOIL

==== Description

The Soil Model described in this chapter contains the essential elements of a data model that allows the exchange of geo-referenced soil data. The model is described in UML, which is then used as a base for the generation of XML Schema Definition (or .xsd) files, which in turn define the XML format that is to be used for the actual exchange of data.

===== Narrative description

The major spatial object types that can be distinguished in the Soil data model are:

* SoilProfile (including Observed and Derived Soil Profiles)
* ProfileElement (including SoilLayer and SoilHorizon)
* SoilBody
* SoilDerivedObject
* SoilThemeCoverage and SoilThemeDescriptiveCoverage
* SoilSite
* SoilPlot

Their meaning and relationships are explained in the following paragraphs. All objects, apart from SoilThemeCoverage and SoilThemeDescriptiveCoverage, are presented in Figure 7– Vector, while Figure 8 presents the UML class diagram for these objects. The used data types and codelists are illustrated in and Figure 9 and Figure 10. The relation to Observations and Measurements is illustrated in Figure 11.

====== _Soil Profile, Layer and Horizon_

The concepts of "observed soil profile" and "derived soil profile" are represented through the classes _ObservedSoilProfile_ and _DerivedSoilProfile_ that are subtypes of the abstract class _SoilProfile_. (see Figure 7)

An observed soil profile represents a geo-referenced soil profile, described in the field, possibly sampled and analyzed in the laboratory.

A derived soil profile is a non-point-located soil profile with property values that are derived (e.g. averaged) from the values of the corresponding properties of one or more observed soil profiles. Even if such a connection to an observed soil profile exists, it is not mandatory to provide it (nor its data) together with the derived soil profile. Eventually, a derived soil profile could also be a standalone non-geo-referenced soil profile, not associated to an observed soil profile and with property values that are e.g. assessed by expert knowledge.

Any soil profile can be characterized as a whole by a number of properties, of which the following are included in the model: its soil type according to the WRB soil classification scheme (_WRBSoilName_) and/or any other soil classification scheme (_otherSoilName_) with the limitation to one per dataset, and zero or more other parameters, which are expressed through _soilProfileObservation_ associations with _OM_Observation_ objects (see Figure 11). Through the _observedProperty_ role of its _Phenomenon_ association, the _OM_Observation_ object designates the parameter, through the attributes _label_, _basePhenomenon_ (value selected from the codelist _SoilProfileParameterNameValue_) (see Figre 10) and _uom_ (unit of measure). Through the _result_ role of the _Range_ association, a value can be given to the parameter; this value should be of the type _Number_, _RangeType_ (a range of values) or _CharacterString_ (e.g. 'good' or 'very high'). Note that the _SoilProfileParameterNameValue_ codelist can be extended by the data provider when needed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex IV / Section 3.4._
*Theme specific requirement*

Only one Other Soil Name Type classification shall be used for a dataset.
====

To promote semantic interoperability and when possible, it is required to use WRB as a classification scheme. On top of _inspireID_, any soil profile can also be identified by a _localIdentifier_, which is a character string that allows tagging of the profile object with any information that relates the object to the originating data source of the data provider.

Note that the _WRBSoilName_ is of type _WRBSoilNameType_ that allows to give _WRBSoilName_ a value according to the WRB structure defined for the WRB2006 update 2007 or later versions. The reference to the WRB version which is actually used is encoded through the values taken from the WRB related codelists (_WRBReferenceSoilGroupValue_, _WRBQualifierValue,_ _WRBSpecifierValue_ and _WRBQualifierPlaceValue_). If a _SoilProfile_ is to be characterized by earlier versions of WRB (e.g. 1998), the _otherSoilName_ attribute should be used.

Any instance of an _ObservedSoilProfile_ is associated to exactly one instance of a _soilPlot_ (see further) from which the _soilPlotLocation_ attribute indicates the position (i.e. where it is located on the earth's surface) and for which the soil data provides valid information.

Any soil profile, whether observed or derived, can be described by horizons and layers. Each horizon and layer can have a number of properties. In the model, layers and horizons are represented by the classes _SoiLayer_ and _SoilHorizon_ which are both subtypes of the abstract class _ProfileElement_. The abstract _SoilProfile_ can consist of one or more __ProfileElement__s.

A horizon or layer is at least characterized by an upper depth and a lower depth, indicating the top and the bottom depth of the horizon or layer from the surface; the attribute in the abstract _ProfileElement_ class that indicates the depths of a horizon or layer is _profileElementDepthRange_.

The properties of horizons and layers are modelled through the _profileElementObservation associations_ with _OM_Observation_ objects (see Figure 11), in the same way as soil profile parameters are modelled, the only difference being that the parameter is selected from the codelist ProfileElementParameterNameValue (see Figure 10). Note that this codelist can be extended by the data provider when needed.

A horizon is further specified by a horizon name according to the FAO horizon notation scheme from 2006 (_FAOHorizonNotation_) and/or any other horizon notation schemes (_otherHorizonNotation_), with the limitation to one per a dataset. A horizon corresponds to a horizontal subdivision of the soil based on pedogenic processes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex IV / Section 3.4_
*Theme specific requirement*

Only one Other Horizon Notation Type classification shall be used for a dataset.
====

A layer corresponds to a horizontal subdivision of the soil based on other criteria than pedogenic processes. The way of defining a layer is specified by a layer type name that indicates the kind of layer considered: _topsoil_, _subsoil_, d__epthInterval__ or _geogenic_; this is modelled through the _layerType_ attribute in the _SoilLayer_ class. _Topsoil_ and _subsoil_ are complementary concepts used to address pedogenic process domains of the soil irrespective of a horizon description. Depth intervals are often used for chemical characterisation of the soil state and relate often to sampling depths. If the _SoilLayer_ is of the type _geogenic_, it is described in terms of its non-pedogenic origin and can additionally be described by the following attributes: _layerRockType_ (which gives petrographic or lithologic information on the rock type the layer is made of) and three attributes with reference to layer genesis (_layerGenesisProcess_, _layerGenesisEnvironment_, _layerGenesisProcessState_). Except for _layerGenesisProcessState_, the involved codelists originate from the INSPIRE Data Specification on Geology.

Note that the values in the codelists _SoilProfileParameterNameValue_ and _ProfileElementParameterNameValue_ (see Figure 10) in this version of the model correspond to requirements concerning soil property data in some European legislation.

Note that, since the parameters for _soilProfile_, _ProfileElement_ and _soilDerivedObject_ (see below) are linked (through the O&M framework, see Figure 11)) to _OM_Observation_, which in turn is associated to _INSPIRE_OM_Process_, it is possible to provide additional information on the process that led to observation values. For example, if soil pH is measured in a salt solution, the kind and concentration of the salt solution as well as the solution to soil proportion and the type of device used can be stated.

*IR Requirement*
_Annex IV / Section 3.4_
*Theme specific requirement*

The values of the first level hierarchical code lists: ProfileElementParameterNameValue, SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue, SoilProfileParameterNameValue, SoilSiteParameterNameValue (chemicalParameter, biologicalParameter, physicalParameter) serve only the purpose of structuring; only the lower-level values shall be used.
====

====== _SoilBody_

To delineate geographically areas with a soil cover that can be characterized by a set of derived soil profiles, the model introduces the construct of the _SoilBody_ class (see Figure 7). It represents an association (or other types of spatial linkages of various soil types) of derived soil profiles that represent the soils found together in the area of the _SoilBody_. The area is specified by the _geometry_ attribute of the _SoilBody_. The presence of one or more kinds of soils in the _SoilBody_ is modelled with the association class _DerivedProfilePresenceInSoilBody_, which allows to indicate which derived soil profiles are used to describe the soils of the _SoilBody_, and to which extent (expressed as a couple of area share percentages). The couple of percentages offer the flexibility to give a range of percentages to express uncertainty on the presence of any soil type. If only one percentage value is to be used, lower and upper boundaries of the couple of percentages should have identical values. Because of this flexibility with ranges of percentages, it is allowed that the sum of all percentage upper boundaries for the derived soil profiles in one soil body is greater than 100%. However, there is the constraint that the sum of all percentage lower boundaries for the derived soil profiles in one soil body is lower than or equal to 100%.

As an example, a _SoilBody_ could consist of one dominant soil (as described by a derived soil profile) and of other soils (described by other derived soil profiles) having characteristics different from the dominant one. A derived soil profile can be used to characterize more than one _SoilBody_.

The _soilBodyLabel_ attribute of the _SoilBody_ allows a description of the _SoilBody_, which may be useful for building legends. The _soilBodyLabel_ contributes to the explanation of a mapping unit of a map, whereas in the metadata linked to the dataset to which the object belongs, a reference should be given to documentation that further explains the labelling of the soil bodies.

Note that although the geometry (polygon areas) of the _SoilBody_ is known and also how much area within it is covered by each of the soils in the area, expressed as a range of percentages, the exact location and spatial pattern of each kind of soils within the _SoilBody_ is not defined.

====== _SoilDerivedObject_

In the context of the model, a _SoilDerivedObject_ (Figure 7) is defined as a spatial object (e.g. a point, line, polygon) representing a soil-related property (using the association _soilDerivedObjectObservation_ with an OM_Observation object, see Figure 11) which value can be (but does not have to be) derived from a) values of soil properties of related observed soil profiles and/or related soil bodies, and/or b) any other data or information intern or extern to the model (for example: instances of other SoilDerivedObjects (intern); landcover/climate data (extern)). A collection of such _SoilDerivedObjects_ constitutes a soil thematic map, and is to be regarded as a dataset. The metadata linked to such a dataset provides the details on how the values for the attributes of the __SoilDerivedObject__s have been calculated.

The _geometry_ attribute of the _SoilDerivedObject_ specifies type and location of the geographical object (e.g. a polygon or a point). Through the association _soilDerivedObjectObservation_ with an OM_Observation object, a parameter is designated and given a value, in the same way as parameters for the soil profiles and profile elements. The parameter is selected from the codelist _SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue_ (see Figure 10); note that this code list can be extended by the data provider when needed.

At _SoilDerivedObject_ object level__,__ the value for the associated parameter in the associated OM_Observation object can be accompanied by zero or more values that provide supplementary information to it. This information is given in zero or more _parameter_ attributes of the _OM_Observation_ object and which values are of the type _NamedValue_. The class _NamedValue_ provides for a generic soft-typed parameter value. NamedValue supports two attributes: _name_ (datatype: _GenericName_) that indicates the meaning of the named value, and _value_ (datatype: _Any_) that provides the value. The type _Any_ should be substituted by a suitable concrete type, e.g. _Number_.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex IV / Section 3.4_
*Theme specific requirement*

When an additional descriptive parameter for the soil derived object is needed, the parameter attribute of the OM_Observation spatial object type shall be used.
====

One example of the use of the _parameter_ attribute in the _OM_Observation_ object is for the construction of so-called "purity maps". When one wants to construct a _SoilDerivedObject_ with as geometry a polygon P and with a parameter that contains a value indicating a soil property A (e.g. WaterDrainageClass), based on values for that same property that are found in the _DerivedSoilProfile_-s associated to a _SoilBody_ covering the same polygon, one could select the value for WaterDrainageClass for the _DerivedSoilProfile_ that is dominant. This is an interpretation of the data and when depicting A as a value in polygon P, the viewer should know that this value is not "pure" and that an amount of information is lost through interpretation. The "purity" of the value for A could be indicated in the _parameter_ attribute of the linked _OM_Observation_ object__,__ which could have a NamedValue consisting of name _purity_ and a value between 0 and 100__,__ computed from the proportions of the _DerivedSoilProfiles_ composing the _SoilBody_.

Because the multiplicity of the associations between the _SoilDerivedObject_ and the _SoilBody_ and _ObservedSoilProfile_ is "0..*" (i.e. zero to many), the _SoilDerivedObject_ class also accommodates for so-called "soil thematic maps" in which the spatial information on a soil property is *not* related to any of the soil objects in the model.

Note that the set of name values in the codelist _SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue_ in this version of the model corresponds to the union of name values of the code lists _SoilProfileParameterNameValue_ and _ProfileElementParameterNameValue_, which in turn correspond to requirements concerning soil property data in some European legislation.

A collection of __SoilDerivedObject__s that may consist of points, lines and/or polygons, is not meant for the exchange of soil thematic data as raster datasets. This feature is implemented with the _SoilThemeCoverage_ class__.__

====== _SoilThemeCoverage, SoilThemeDescriptiveCoverage_

The specific purpose of the _SoilThemeCoverage_ class (see Figure 8) is to provide a structure for the interchange of soil thematic maps as continuous phenomena. The geometry is represented as a coverage which is defined as a "feature that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal domain". For soil this commonly is a rectified grid.

The attribute _soilThemeParameter_ is of the datatype _SoilThemeParameterType_ that consists of a _soilThemeParameterName_ (to be taken from the codelist _SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue_, e.g. _organicCarbonContent_) (see Figure 10) and a unit of measure (e.g. cm). Note that the code list _SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue_ can be extended by the data provider when needed.

The values of the gridcells are covered by a rangeSet constraint that says that values shall be of one of the types Number; RangeType or CharacterString.

Since it may be useful to associate to a coverage other coverages of which the cell values are supplementary information to the corresponding grid cells of the coverage itself, the _SoilThemeCoverage_ class has an association to another coverage, the _SoilThemeDescriptiveCoverage_. The _SoilThemeDescriptiveCoverage_ has the same spatial and domain extent as the associated _SoilThemeCoverage_. The attribute _soilThemeDescriptiveParameter_ is of the datatype _SoilThemeDescriptiveParameterType_ that consists of a _soilThemeDescriptiveParameterName_ (characterstring, e.g. _purity_) and a unit of measure (e.g. cm). The _soilThemeDescriptiveParameter_ gives supplementary information on the grid cell values of the associated coverage, often it concerns qualitative information. An example would be the provision of "purity maps" in relation to for instance soil texture maps.

====== _SoilSite, SoilPlot_

A "soil site" is considered as a wider geographical area, i.e. the larger piece of land where soil investigation takes place in one or more spots, called soil plots. A site represents often just the geographically not strictly defined environment of the plots; thus, the geometry attribute of the soil site can be a surface or a point location. In soil survey and general soil monitoring, all soil information gathered on one site is handled as if it would have been collected at the very same location, which is impossible in the strict sense in the real world whenever soil investigation is destructive. The purpose of this investigation can be general (e.g. taking soil profiles for a general soil characterization) or specific (e.g. sampling to investigate potentially contaminated land). The soil plot object is included in the model to provide the type and location of the associated observed soil profile. A soil plot within a soil site is of a certain type (_borehole_, _sample_, _trial pit_) and located by a geographical point and/or the name of a location.

To a soil plot, one observed soil profile must be associated.

A soil site is represented in the model with the _SoilSite_ class (see Figure 7). Its _soilInvestigationPurpose_ attribute indicates the purpose of investigation: general (_generalSoilSurvey_) or specific (_specificSoilSurvey_). This kind of information can be crucial for data evaluation to identify bias in the selection of sites.

The possible properties of a soil site are modelled through the _soilSiteObservation associations_ with _OM_Observation_ objects (see Figure 11), in the same way as soil profile parameters are modelled, the only difference being that the parameter is selected from the codelist _SoilSiteParameterNameValue_. Note that this codelist can be extended by the data provider when needed.

A soil plot is represented in the model with the _SoilPlot_ class. A _SoilSite_ comprises one or more __SoilPlot-__s. A soil plot is of a certain type (_soilPlotType_), and its location is indicated by the attribute _soilPlotLocation_ which can take the form of either a specific X,Y-location or a description of the location using text or an identifier.

====== _Note on Observations_

For the data specifications of soil, the Observations & Measurements standard (O & M) is used (see Figure 11). The Observations & Measurements standard defines a domain-independent conceptual model for the representation of (spatiotemporal) measurement and other observation data. ISO 19156 defines an application schema as a reference schema for data required by one or more applications. O & M can be used as a generic means to deal with measurements and other observations in a standardized way. From that standard, _OM_Observation_ is used in the soil model; from the INSPIRE O&M package, the _INSPIRE_OM_Process_ and the data type _ObservableProperty_ are used in the soil model. This means that for each observation the _phenomenonTime_ and _resultTime_ are always used and additional properties may be used. The _resultTime_ for soil is usually the same time as the _PhenomenonTime_ unless the analysis is not carried out in the field. For the process information, at least a name and a responsible party have to be provided. Additionally, other properties that refer to online or offline documentation can be used. When needed, process parameters can be provided. For instance, for the soil profile parameter with the name carbonStock, which is placed in the _basePhenomenon_ attribute of the _ObservableProperty_ type, the _processParameter_ attribute of the _INSPIRE_OM_Process_ class (that is linked to the _ObservableProperty_) could hold a value that indicates the depth to which this carbonStock value pertains.

In the model, all the information related to the observation is considered to be the evidence of the value of the property belonging to the feature of interest (i.e. the relevant soil object). This evidence is associated to the feature of interest. In the soil application schema, this is associated to either _soilProfile_, _ProfileElement_, _SoilDerivedObject_ or _SoilSite_ as being the "feature of interest".

NOTE 1 If several derived soil profiles are used to describe the soil body, the spatial distribution of the soil they describe within the soil body is not defined, but their presence is indicated by a range percentage of area. The underlying reason behind the fact of not delineating the different soils within a soil body is the target scale of the map or spatial dataset. This means that geographical accuracy and preciseness of soil characterization depend on and vary with the target scale, i.e. the soil body can be delineated differently among scales.

!  !Description: !NOTE1 Different kinds of layer concepts are covered by this definition. 
 
EXAMPLE 1 Geogenic layers: These are domains, resulting from e.g. sedimentation (as non-pedogenic) processes, that display an unconformity to possibly over- or underlying adjacent domains. 
 
EXAMPLE 2 Topsoil and Subsoil: These can be domains that group different soil horizon types (e.g. A vs. B horizons), or a special case of fixed depths with only two depth ranges (e.g. 0-15 cm: topsoil and, 15-75 cm: subsoil). 
 
EXAMPLE 3 Depth intervals: They are often used in soil monitoring, sampling of contaminated sites and in modelling and include: (i) depth increments (also called fixed depths) that are often used for sampling, e.g. 0-30cm, 30-60cm, and so on, (ii) a single depth range in which a soil sample ("specimen") is taken and for which the analytical result is valid, and (iii) soil slicing, that is, profile segmentation according to a specified vector, for instance, either regularly spaced intervals (1cm), or a user-defined vector of segment boundaries (i.e. 0-10, 10-25, 25-50, 50-100). Slicing is used in modelling to generate continuous depth functions for soil properties. 
 
EXAMPLE 4: In the framework of soils deeply modified by human activity, artificial layers may be due to different kinds of deposits (concrete, bricks, ...).

!  !Name: !soil site
!  !Definition: !area within a larger survey, study or monitored area, where a specific soil investigation is carried out.
!  !Description: !Site provides the object to describe: 
a.) the surroundings of the plot 
 
and/or 
 
b.) the larger piece of land that is directly linked to and described by all soil investigations on its one or more spots (SoilPlots). It thus provides the object to which soil data of different kind (or the same kind, but at different points in time, e.g. in soil monitoring) obtained on different plots is related as if it would have been collected at the very same place. This allows for: 
 
1. combination of data that cannot be obtained on the very same place 
EXAMPLE: a soil pit and investigations on earthworm abundance cannot be done in the same place, but possibly some metres apart from each other. Nonetheless shall the results of both investigations be combined to inform about the soil state. 
or 
2. comparison of soil condition after some time has elapsed. 
EXAMPLE: Organic carbon stock has been investigated using data from two monitoring periods that had to be conducted on spatially slightly separated places because the sampling is destructive. Nonetheless are the results of both periods regarded as giving an idea how organic carbon stock has changed over the years at the same place. 
 
The site is also the object to state the date and time information on validity, etc. 
 
The soil site might have delineation, but can be located with a centre or reference point location only. Delineated soil sites - possibly in the form of cadastral parcels - are especially used in the inventory of contaminated areas. 
 
NOTE Any plot can be linked to one specific site only, but several plots to one site.

NOTE The horizon notation according to FAO (2006) is a combination of several symbols: 
· A number that gives information about discontinuities, i.e. the number of the material in which the soil has formed, counted up from the soil surface, but not for the first material. 
· One or two capital letters that designate the type of master horizon (or transitional horizon), possibly separated by a slash 
· Lower case letters that designate subordinate characteristics of the horizon. 
· A number that designates horizontal subdivisions of otherwise similarly denoted horizon parts 
· A prime that enables to distinguish two horizons that have the same naming, but formed in different cycles of pedogenesis.

!  !Name: !FAO horizon discontinuity
!  !Value type: !Integer
!  !Definition: !number used to indicate a discontinuity in the horizon notation.
!  !Description: !In mineral soils, Arabic numerals are used as prefixes to indicate discontinuities. Wherever needed, they are used preceding A, E, B, C and R. They are not used with I and W, although these symbols clearly indicate a discontinuity. These prefixes are distinct from Arabic numerals used as suffixes to denote vertical subdivisions. 
A discontinuity is a significant change in particle-size distribution or mineralogy that indicates a difference in the material from which the horizons formed or a significant difference in age or both, unless that difference in age is indicated by the suffix b. Symbols to identify discontinuities are used only when they will contribute substantially to the reader's understanding of relationships among horizons. The stratification common in soils formed in alluvium is not designated as discontinuities unless particle-size distribution differs markedly from layer to layer even though genetic horizons have formed in the contrasting layers. 
Where a soil has formed entirely in one kind of material, a prefix is omitted from the symbol; the whole profile is material 1. Similarly, the uppermost material in a profile having two or more contrasting materials is understood to be material 1, but the number is omitted. Numbering starts with the second layer of contrasting material, which is designated 2. Underlying contrasting layers are numbered consecutively.

The sequence A-E-Bt-E-Btx-C is an example - the soil has two E horizons. To make communication easier, a prime is used with the master horizon symbol of the lower of two horizons having identical letter designations: A-E-Bt-E'-Btx-C.The prime is applied to the capital letter designation, and any lower case symbol follows it: B't. The prime is not used unless all letters of the designations of two different layers are identical. Prime can be used for both minerals or organic soils.

== Reference systems, units of measure and grids

=== Default reference systems, units of measure and grid

The reference systems, units of measure and geographic grid systems included in this sub-section are the defaults to be used for all INSPIRE data sets, unless theme-specific exceptions and/or additional requirements are defined in section 6.2.

==== Coordinate reference systems

===== Datum

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.2_
*Datum for three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems*

For the three-dimensional and two-dimensional coordinate reference systems and the horizontal component of compound coordinate reference systems used for making spatial data sets available, the datum shall be the datum of the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) in areas within its geographical scope, or the datum of the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) or other geodetic coordinate reference systems compliant with ITRS in areas that are outside the geographical scope of ETRS89. Compliant with the ITRS means that the system definition is based on the definition of the ITRS and there is a well documented relationship between both systems, according to EN ISO 19111.

====

===== Coordinate reference systems

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.3_
*Coordinate Reference Systems*

Spatial data sets shall be made available using at least one of the coordinate reference systems specified in sections 1.3.1, 1.3.2 and 1.3.3, unless one of the conditions specified in section 1.3.4 holds.

*1.3.1. Three-dimensional Coordinate Reference Systems*

* Three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) ellipsoid.
* Three-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude and ellipsoidal height) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.

*1.3.2. Two-dimensional Coordinate Reference Systems*

* Two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude and longitude) based on a datum specified in 1.2 and using the parameters of the GRS80 ellipsoid.
* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area coordinate reference system.
* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Lambert Conformal Conic coordinate reference system.
* Plane coordinates using the ETRS89 Transverse Mercator coordinate reference system.

*1.3.3. Compound Coordinate Reference Systems*

1. For the horizontal component of the compound coordinate reference system, one of the coordinate reference systems specified in section 1.3.2 shall be used.

2. For the vertical component, one of the following coordinate reference systems shall be used:

* For the vertical component on land, the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS) shall be used to express gravity-related heights within its geographical scope. Other vertical reference systems related to the Earth gravity field shall be used to express gravity-related heights in areas that are outside the geographical scope of EVRS.
* For the vertical component in the free atmosphere, barometric pressure, converted to height using ISO 2533:1975 International Standard Atmosphere, or other linear or parametric reference systems shall be used. Where other parametric reference systems are used, these shall be described in an accessible reference using EN ISO 19111-2:2012.
* For the vertical component in marine areas where there is an appreciable tidal range (tidal waters), the Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) shall be used as the reference surface.
* For the vertical component in marine areas without an appreciable tidal range, in open oceans and effectively in waters that are deeper than 200 meters, the Mean Sea Level (MSL) or a well-defined reference level close to the MSL shall be used as the reference surface.

*1.3.4. Other Coordinate Reference Systems*

Exceptions, where other coordinate reference systems than those listed in 1.3.1, 1.3.2 or 1.3.3 may be used, are:

1. Other coordinate reference systems may be specified for specific spatial data themes in this Annex.

2. For regions outside of continental Europe, Member States may define suitable coordinate reference systems.

The geodetic codes and parameters needed to describe these coordinate reference systems and to allow conversion and transformation operations shall be documented and an identifier shall be created, according to EN ISO 19111 and ISO 19127.
====

===== Display

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.4_
*Coordinate Reference Systems used in the View Network Service*

For the display of spatial data sets with the view network service as specified in Regulation No 976/2009, at least the coordinate reference systems for two-dimensional geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude) shall be available.

====

===== Identifiers for coordinate reference systems

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 1.5_
*Coordinate Reference System Identifiers*

1. Coordinate reference system parameters and identifiers shall be managed in one or several common registers for coordinate reference systems.

2. Only identifiers contained in a common register shall be used for referring to the coordinate reference systems listed in this Section.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to use the http URIs provided by the Open Geospatial Consortium as coordinate reference system identifiers (see identifiers for the default CRSs below). These are based on and redirect to the definition in the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Registry (_http://www.epsg-registry.org/_).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 2*

The identifiers listed in Table 2 shall be used for referring to the coordinate reference systems used in a data set.

====

NOTE CRS identifiers may be used e.g. in:

* data encoding,
* data set and service metadata, and
* requests to INSPIRE network services.

==== Temporal reference system

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 11_
*Temporal Reference Systems*

1. The default temporal reference system referred to in point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (footnote:[OJ L 326, 4.12.2008, p. 12.]) shall be used, unless other temporal reference systems are specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE 1 Point 5 of part B of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1205/2008 (the INSPIRE Metadata IRs) states that the default reference system shall be the Gregorian calendar, with dates expressed in accordance with ISO 8601.

NOTE 2 ISO 8601 _Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times_ is an international standard covering the exchange of date and time-related data. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data is transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times. The standard organizes the data so the largest temporal term (the year) appears first in the data string and progresses to the smallest term (the second). It also provides for a standardized method of communicating time-based information across time zones by attaching an offset to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

EXAMPLE 1997 (the year 1997), 1997-07-16 (16^th^ July 1997), 1997-07-16T19:20:3001:00 (16^th^ July 1997, 19h 20' 30'', time zone: UTC1)

==== Units of measure

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 12_
*Other Requirements & Rules*

(...)

2. All measurement values shall be expressed using SI units or non-SI units accepted for use with the International System of Units, unless specified otherwise for a specific spatial data theme or type.

====

==== Grids

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex II, Section 2.2_
*Grids*

Either of the grids with fixed and unambiguously defined locations defined in Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 shall be used as a geo-referencing framework to make gridded data available in INSPIRE, unless one of the following conditions holds:

(1) Other grids may be specified for specific spatial data themes in Annexes II-IV. In this case, data exchanged using such a theme-specific grid shall use standards in which the grid definition is either included with the data, or linked by reference.

(2) For grid referencing in regions outside of continental Europe Member States may define their own grid based on a geodetic coordinate reference system compliant with ITRS and a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection, following the same principles as laid down for the grid specified in Section 2.2.1. In this case, an identifier for the coordinate reference system shall be created.

*2.2 Equal Area Grid*

The grid is based on the ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (ETRS89-LAEA) coordinate reference system with the centre of the projection at the point 52^o^ N, 10^o^ E and false easting: x~0~ = 4321000 m, false northing: y~0~ = 3210000 m.

The origin of the grid coincides with the false origin of the ETRS89-LAEA coordinate reference system (x=0, y=0).

Grid points of grids based on ETRS89-LAEA shall coincide with grid points of the grid.

The grid is hierarchical, with resolutions of 1m, 10m, 100m, 1000m, 10000m and 100000m.

The grid orientation is south-north, west-east.

The grid is designated as Grid_ETRS89-LAEA. For identification of an individual resolution level the cell size in metres is appended.

For the unambiguous referencing and identification of a grid cell, the cell code composed of the size of the cell and the coordinates of the lower left cell corner in ETRS89-LAEA shall be used. The cell size shall be denoted in metres ("m") for cell sizes up to 100m or kilometres ("km") for cell sizes of 1000m and above. Values for northing and easting shall be divided by 10^n^, where _n_ is the number of trailing zeros in the cell size value.

====

=== Theme-specific requirements and recommendations

There are no theme-specific requirements or recommendations on reference systems and grids.

<<<
== Data quality

This chapter includes a description of the data quality elements and sub-elements as well as the corresponding data quality measures that should be used to evaluate and document data quality for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Soil_ (section 7.1).

It may also define requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Soil_ (sections 7.2 and 957.3).

In particular, the data quality elements, sub-elements and measures specified in section 7.1 should be used for

* evaluating and documenting data quality properties and constraints of spatial objects, where such properties or constraints are defined as part of the application schema(s) (see section 5);
* evaluating and documenting data quality metadata elements of spatial data sets (see section 8); and/or
* specifying requirements or recommendations about the targeted data quality results applicable for data sets related to the spatial data theme _Soil_ (see sections 7.2 and 7.3).


The descriptions of the elements and measures are based on Annex D of ISO/DIS 19157 Geographic information – Data quality.

=== Data quality elements

[.text-center]
Table 3 lists all data quality elements and sub-elements that are being used in this specification. Data quality information can be evaluated at level of spatial object, spatial object type, dataset or dataset series. The level at which the evaluation is performed is given in the "Evaluation Scope" column.

The measures to be used for each of the listed data quality sub-elements are defined in the following sub-sections.

Table 3 – Data quality elements used in the spatial data theme _Soil_

== Dataset-level metadata

This section specifies dataset-level metadata elements, which should be used for documenting metadata for a complete dataset or dataset series.

NOTE Metadata can also be reported for each individual spatial object (spatial object-level metadata). Spatial object-level metadata is fully described in the application schema(s) (section 5).

For some dataset-level metadata elements, in particular those for reporting data quality and maintenance, a more specific scope can be specified. This allows the definition of metadata at sub-dataset level, e.g. separately for each spatial object type (see instructions for the relevant metadata element).

=== Metadata elements defined in INSPIRE Metadata Regulation

[.text-center]
Table 4 gives an overview of the metadata elements specified in Regulation 1205/2008/EC (implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards metadata).

The table contains the following information:

* The first column provides a reference to the relevant section in the Metadata Regulation, which contains a more detailed description.
* The second column specifies the name of the metadata element.
* The third column specifies the multiplicity.
* The fourth column specifies the condition, under which the given element becomes mandatory.

Generic guidelines for implementing these elements using ISO 19115 and 19119 are available at _http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/101_. The following sections describe additional theme-specific recommendations and requirements for implementing these elements.

==== Conformity

The _Conformity_ metadata element defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC requires to report the conformance with the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services. In addition, it may be used also to document the conformance to another specification.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 11*

Dataset metadata should include a statement on the overall conformance of the dataset with this data specification (i.e. conformance with all requirements).

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 12*

The _Conformity_ metadata element should be used to document conformance with this data specification (as a whole), with a specific conformance class defined in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A and/or with another specification.

====

The _Conformity_ element includes two sub-elements, the _Specification_ (a citation of the Implementing Rule for interoperability of spatial data sets and services or other specification), and the _Degree_ of conformity. The _Degree_ can be _Conformant_ (if the dataset is fully conformant with the cited specification), _Not Conformant_ (if the dataset does not conform to the cited specification) or _Not Evaluated_ (if the conformance has not been evaluated).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 13*

If a dataset is not yet conformant with all requirements of this data specification, it is recommended to include information on the conformance with the individual conformance classes specified in the Abstract Test Suite in Annex A.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 14*

If a dataset is produced or transformed according to an external specification that includes specific quality assurance procedures, the conformity with this specification should be documented using the _Conformity_ metadata element.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 15*

If minimum data quality recommendations are defined then the statement on the conformity with these requirements should be included using the _Conformity_ metadata element and referring to the relevant data quality conformance class in the Abstract Test Suite.

====

NOTE Currently no minimum data quality requirements are included in the IRs. The recommendation above should be included as a requirement in the IRs if minimum data quality requirements are defined at some point in the future.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 16*

When documenting conformance with this data specification or one of the conformance classes defined in the Abstract Test Suite, the _Specification_ sub-element should be given using the http URI identifier of the conformance class or using a citation including the following elements:

* title: "INSPIRE Data Specification on _Soil_ – Draft Guidelines – name of the conformance class>"
* date:
** dateType: publication
** date: 2013-01-24

==== Lineage

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 17*

Following the ISO/DIS 19157 Quality principles, if a data provider has a procedure for the quality management of their spatial data sets then the appropriate data quality elements and measures defined in ISO/DIS 19157 should be used to evaluate and report (in the metadata) the results. If not, the _Lineage_ metadata element (defined in Regulation 1205/2008/EC) should be used to describe the overall quality of a spatial data set.

====

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, lineage "is a statement on process history and/or overall quality of the spatial data set. Where appropriate it may include a statement whether the data set has been validated or quality assured, whether it is the official version (if multiple versions exist), and whether it has legal validity. The value domain of this metadata element is free text".

The Metadata Technical Guidelines based on EN ISO 19115 and EN ISO 19119 specifies that the statement sub-element of LI_Lineage (EN ISO 19115) should be used to implement the lineage metadata element.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 18*

To describe the transformation steps and related source data, it is recommended to use the following sub-elements of LI_Lineage:

====

- For the description of the transformation process of the local to the common INSPIRE data structures, the LI_ProcessStep sub-element should be used.

- For the description of the source data the LI_Source sub-element should be used.

NOTE 1 In order to improve the interoperability, domain templates and instructions for using these free text elements (descriptive statements) may be specified here and/or in an Annex of this data specification.

===== Theme specific recommendation on the use of Lineage

The Lineage metadata field should be used to

* state which source data have been used to produce the current dataset;
* resulting limitations to the use of the dataset, e.g. regarding scale, and
* describe known errors or shortcomings of the dataset.

If data on soil or other kinds of classification are included in the dataset, the classification systems should be stated or described as well.

==== Temporal reference

According to Regulation 1205/2008/EC, at least one of the following temporal reference metadata sub-elements shall be provided: temporal extent, date of publication, date of last revision, date of creation.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 19*

It is recommended that at least the date of the last revision of a spatial data set should be reported using the _Date of last revision_ metadata sub-element.

====

=== Metadata elements for interoperability

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 13
*Metadata required for Interoperability*

The metadata describing a spatial data set shall include the following metadata elements required for interoperability:

1. Coordinate Reference System: Description of the coordinate reference system(s) used in the data set.

2. Temporal Reference System: Description of the temporal reference system(s) used in the data set.

This element is mandatory only if the spatial data set contains temporal information that does not refer to the default temporal reference system.

3. Encoding: Description of the computer language construct(s) specifying the representation of data objects in a record, file, message, storage device or transmission channel.

4. Topological Consistency: Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the data set as described by the scope.

This element is mandatory only if the data set includes types from the Generic Network Model and does not assure centreline topology (connectivity of centrelines) for the network.

5. Character Encoding: The character encoding used in the data set.

This element is mandatory only if an encoding is used that is not based on UTF-8.

6. Spatial Representation Type: The method used to spatially represent geographic information.

====

These Technical Guidelines propose to implement the required metadata elements based on ISO 19115 and ISO/TS 19139.

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with the proposed encoding.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 3*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the used ISO 19139 XML schema.

====

NOTE Section 2.1.2 of the Metadata Technical Guidelines discusses the different ISO 19139 XML schemas that are currently available.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 4*

Metadata instance (XML) documents shall contain the elements and meet the INSPIRE multiplicity specified in the sections below.

====

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 5*

The elements specified below shall be available in the specified ISO/TS 19139 path.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 20*

The metadata elements for interoperability should be made available together with the metadata elements defined in the Metadata Regulation through an INSPIRE discovery service.

====

NOTE While this not explicitly required by any of the INSPIRE Implementing Rules, making all metadata of a data set available together and through one service simplifies implementation and usability.

==== Metadata elements for reporting data quality

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 23*

For reporting the results of the data quality evaluation, the data quality elements, sub-elements and (for quantitative evaluation) measures defined in chapter 7 should be used.

====

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 24*

The metadata elements specified in the following sections should be used to report the results of the data quality evaluation. At least the information included in the row "Implementation instructions" should be provided.

====

The first section applies to reporting quantitative results (using the element DQ_QuantitativeResult), while the second section applies to reporting non-quantitative results (using the element DQ_DescriptiveResult).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 25*

If a dataset does not pass the tests of the Application schema conformance class (defined in Annex A), the results of each test should be reported using one of the options described in sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2.

====

NOTE 1 If using non-quantitative description, the results of several tests do not have to be reported separately, but may be combined into one descriptive statement.

NOTE 2 The sections 8.3.2.1 and 8.3.2.2 may need to be updated once the XML schemas for ISO 19157 have been finalised.

The scope for reporting may be different from the scope for evaluating data quality (see section 7). If data quality is reported at the data set or spatial object type level, the results are usually derived or aggregated.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 26*

The scope element (of type DQ_Scope) of the DQ_DataQuality subtype should be used to encode the reporting scope.

Only the following values should be used for the level element of DQ_Scope: Series, Dataset, featureType.

If the level is featureType the levelDescription/MDScopeDescription/features element (of type Set GF_FeatureType>) shall be used to list the feature type names.

====

NOTE In the level element of DQ_Scope, the value featureType is used to denote spatial object type.

=== Updates

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 8_
*Updates*

1. Member States shall make available updates of data on a regular basis.

2. All updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set, unless a different period is specified for a specific spatial data theme in Annex II.

====

NOTE In this data specification, no exception is specified, so all updates shall be made available at the latest 6 months after the change was applied in the source data set.

=== Delivery medium

According to Article 11(1) of the INSPIRE Directive, Member States shall establish and operate a network of services for INSPIRE spatial data sets and services. The relevant network service types for making spatial data available are:

* _view services_ making it possible, as a minimum, to display, navigate, zoom in/out, pan, or overlay viewable spatial data sets and to display legend information and any relevant content of metadata;
* _download services_, enabling copies of spatial data sets, or parts of such sets, to be downloaded and, where practicable, accessed directly;
* _transformation services_, enabling spatial data sets to be transformed with a view to achieving interoperability.

NOTE For the relevant requirements and recommendations for network services, see the relevant Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelinesfootnote:[The Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines on INSPIRE Network Services are available at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/5].

EXAMPLE 1 Through the Get Spatial Objects function, a download service can either download a pre-defined data set or pre-defined part of a data set (non-direct access download service), or give direct access to the spatial objects contained in the data set, and download selections of spatial objects based upon a query (direct access download service). To execute such a request, some of the following information might be required:

* the list of spatial object types and/or predefined data sets that are offered by the download service (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation),
* and the query capabilities section advertising the types of predicates that may be used to form a query expression (to be provided through the Get Download Service Metadata operation, where applicable),
* a description of spatial object types offered by a download service instance (to be provided through the Describe Spatial Object Types operation).

EXAMPLE 2 Through the Transform function, a transformation service carries out data content transformations from native data forms to the INSPIRE-compliant form and vice versa. If this operation is directly called by an application to transform source data (e.g. obtained through a download service) that is not yet conformant with this data specification, the following parameters are required:

Input data (mandatory). The data set to be transformed.

* Source model (mandatory, if cannot be determined from the input data). The model in which the input data is provided.
* Target model (mandatory). The model in which the results are expected.
* Model mapping (mandatory, unless a default exists). Detailed description of how the transformation is to be carried out.

=== Encodings

The IRs contain the following two requirements for the encoding to be used to make data available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 7_
*Encoding*

1. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall conform to EN ISO 19118. In particular, it shall specify schema conversion rules for all spatial object types and all attributes and association roles and the output data structure used.

2. Every encoding rule used to encode spatial data shall be made available.

====

NOTE ISO 19118:2011 specifies the requirements for defining encoding rules used for interchange of geographic data within the set of International Standards known as the "ISO 19100 series". An encoding rule allows geographic information defined by application schemas and standardized schemas to be coded into a system-independent data structure suitable for transport and storage. The encoding rule specifies the types of data being coded and the syntax, structure and coding schemes used in the resulting data structure. Specifically, ISO 19118:2011 includes

* requirements for creating encoding rules based on UML schemas,
* requirements for creating encoding services, and
* requirements for XML-based encoding rules for neutral interchange of data.

While the IRs do not oblige the usage of a specific encoding, these Technical Guidelines propose to make data related to the spatial data theme _Soil_ available at least in the default encoding(s) specified in section 0. In this section, a number of TG requirements are listed that need to be met in order to be conformant with the default encoding(s).

The proposed default encoding(s) meet the requirements in Article 7 of the IRs, i.e. they are conformant with ISO 19118 and (since they are included in this specification) publicly available.

==== Default Encoding(s)

===== Specific requirements for GML encoding

This data specification proposes the use of GML as the default encoding, as recommended in sections 7.2 and 7.3 of [DS-D2.7]. GML is an XML encoding in compliance with ISO 19118, as required in Article 7(1). For details, see [ISO 19136], and in particular Annex E (UML-to-GML application schema encoding rules).

The following TG requirements need to be met in order to be conformant with GML encodings.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 6*

Data instance (XML) documents shall validate without error against the provided XML schema.

====

NOTE 1 Not all constraints defined in the application schemas can be mapped to XML. Therefore, the following requirement is necessary.

NOTE 2 The obligation to use only the allowed code list values specified for attributes and most of the constraints defined in the application schemas cannot be mapped to the XML sch. They can therefore not be enforced through schema validation. It may be possible to express some of these constraints using other schema or rule languages (e.g. Schematron), in order to enable automatic validation.

===== Default encoding(s) for application schema application schema name

*Name: Soil GML Application Schema*

Version: version 3.0,
Specification: D2.8.III.3 Data Specification on _Soil_ – Technical Guidelines
Character set: UTF-8
The xml schema document is available from _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/schemas/so/3.0/Soil.xsd_

==== Recommended Encoding(s)

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 27*

It is recommended that also the encodings specified in this section be provided for the relevant application schemas.

====

NOTE In the Annex D the TWG has prepared the SoilContamination data model extension that includes the feature catalogue. It is recommended as a starting point for further development.

=== Options for delivering coverage data

For coverages, different encodings may be used for the domain and the range of the coverage. There are several options for packaging the domain and range encoding when delivering coverage data through a download service, as discussed belowfootnote:[Further details and examples will be included in a future version of the Guidelines for the encoding of spatial data [DS-D2.7].].

*Multipart representation*

For performance reasons, binary file formats are usually preferred to text-based formats such as XML for storing large amounts of coverage data. However, they cannot directly constitute an alternative to pure GML, since their own data structure might often not support all the ISO 19123 elements used to describe coverages in the conceptual model.

The OGC standard GML Application Schema for coverages [OGC 09-146r2] offers a format encoding which combines these two approaches. The first part consists of a GML document representing all coverage components except the range set, which is contained in the second part in some other encoding format such as 'well known' binary formats'. Some information in the second part may be redundant with the GML content of the first part. In this case, consistency must be necessarily ensured, for example by defining a GML mapping of the additional encoding format.

The advantage of this multipart representation is that coverage constituents are not handled individually but as a whole. This is not really the case with GML which also allows the encoding of the value side of the coverage in external binary files, but via references to remote locations.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 7*

Coverage data encoded as multipart messages shall comply with the multipart representation conformance class defined in GML Application Schema for Coverages [OGC 09-146r2].

====

NOTE The GML Application Schema for Coverages establishes a one-to-one relationship between coverages and multipart document instances.

*Reference to an external file*

The range set can be encoded within the XML structure as an external binary file using the gml:File element. This has the benefit of efficiently storing the range set data within an external file that is of a well-known format type, for example TIFF or GeoTIFF. This method of encoding is of most use for the storage of large files.

*Encoding the range inline*

This option encodes the range set data within the XML inline. This is encoded as a DataBlock element. This encoding provides much greater visibility for the range set values, however, this comes at the cost of reduced efficiency. This method of encoding would therefore only be suitable for small datasets.

*Encoding the domain inside a JPEG 2000 file*

This option consists in packaging all the components of one or several coverages, including the domain expressed in GML, in a single JPEG 2000 file. It is based on the OGC standard GML in JPEG 2000 for Geographic Imagery [OGC 05-047r2], also known as GMLJP2, which specifies how to use GML within the XML boxes of JPEG 2000 files.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 8*

Coverage data encoded in standalone JPEG 2000 files shall comply with the OGC standard GML in JPEG 2000 for Geographic Imagery [OGC 05-047r2].
====

TG Requirement 8 implies that all the encoding rules presented in GMLJP2 shall be strictly followed for including GML within JPEG 2000 data files correctly. For the sake of harmonization, the encoding rules adopted for the multipart message encoding should also apply to the GMLJP2 encoding.

*9.4.1.1 The encoding of coverage components in GMLJP2 within a JPEG 2000 file should conform to the rules specified in the Guidelines for the encoding of spatial data [DS-D2.7].optional encoding for the coverage part of the application schema Soil*

For _Soil_ Theme and associated _Soil_ Theme Descriptive spatial object types that provide the possibility to exchange soil thematic maps information as coverages the following encodings are recommended:

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 1*

The recommended coverage encodings for SoilThemeCoverage, SoilThemeDescribtedCoverage spatial object types are: GeoTIFF and JPEG2000.

====

The encoding of coverage components in GMLJP2 within a JPEG 2000 file should conform to the rules specified in the Guidelines for the encoding of spatial data [DS-D2.7]

<<<
== Data Capture

There is no specific guidance required with respect to data capture.

<<<
== Portrayal

This clause defines the rules for layers and styles to be used for portrayal of the spatial object types defined for this theme. Portrayal is regulated in Article 14 of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 14_
*Portrayal*

1. For the portrayal of spatial data sets using a view network service as specified in Commission Regulation No 976/2009 (footnote:[OJ L 274, 20.10.2009, p. 9.]), the following shall be available:
(a) the layers specified in Annex II for the theme or themes the data set is related to;
(b) for each layer at least a default portrayal style, with as a minimum an associated title and a unique identifier.

2. For each layer, Annex II defines the following:
(a) a human readable title of the layer to be used for display in user interface;
(b) the spatial object type(s), or sub-set thereof, that constitute(s) the content of the layer.

====

In section 11.1, the _types_ of layers are defined that are to be used for the portrayal of the spatial object types defined in this specification. A view service may offer several layers of the same type, one for each dataset that it offers data on a specific topic.

NOTE The layer specification in the IRs only contains the name, a human readable title and the (subset(s) of) spatial object type(s), that constitute(s) the content of the layer. In addition, these Technical Guidelines suggest keywords for describing the layer.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 28*

It is recommended to use the keywords specified in section 11.1 in the _Layers Metadata parameters_ of the INSPIRE View service (see Annex III, Part A, section 2.2.4 in Commission Regulation (EC) No 976/2009).

====

Section 11.2 specifies one style for each of these layers. It is proposed that INSPIRE view services support this style as the default style required by Article 14(1b).

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 9*

For each layer specified in this section, the styles defined in section 11.2 shall be available.

====

NOTE The default style should be used for portrayal by the view network service if no user-defined style is specified in a portrayal request for a specific layer.

In section 11.3, further styles can be specified that represent examples of styles typically used in a thematic domain. It is recommended that also these styles should be supported by INSPIRE view services, where applicable.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 29*

In addition, it is recommended that, where applicable, INSPIRE view services also support the styles defined in section 11.3.

====

Where XML fragments are used in the following sections, the following namespace prefixes apply:

* sld="http://www.opengis.net/sld" (WMS/SLD 1.1)
* se="http://www.opengis.net/se" (SE 1.1)
* ogc="http://www.opengis.net/ogc" (FE 1.1)

In the data specifications for SOIL, any instance of the SoilBody object 'is described by' one or more instances of the DerivedSoilProfile object. If the _WRBSoilName_ attribute of these instances hold valid values (i.e. values of the type WRBSoilNameType), one could derive (through an algorithm) a WRB Reference Soil Group value to be associated with the instance of the SoilBody object.

The style SO.SoilBody.WRB is for filling the polygons defined by the _geometry_ attribute with a colour associated with the computed WRB Reference Soil Group. This SO.SoilBody.WRB style additionally outlines the polygons as defined in the SO.SoilBody.Default style.

There is one colour defined for each of the 32 WRB Reference Soil Groups (RSG):

[appendix]
== Abstract Test Suite (normative)

|===
|*Disclaimer*
While this Annex refers to the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services, it does not replace the legal act or any part of it.
|===

The objective of the Abstract Test Suite (ATS) included in this Annex is to help the conformance testing process. It includes a set of tests to be applied on a data set to evaluate whether it fulfils the requirements included in this data specification and the corresponding parts of Commission Regulation No 1089/2010 (implementing rule as regards interoperability of spatial datasets and services, further referred to as ISDSS Regulation). This is to help data providers in declaring the conformity of a data set to the "degree of conformity, with implementing rules adopted under Article 7(1) of Directive 2007/2/EC", which is required to be provided in the data set metadata according to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2008/1205 (the Metadata Regulation).

*Part 1* of this ATS includes tests that provide *input for assessing conformity with the ISDSS regulation.* In order to make visible which requirements are addressed by a specific test, references to the corresponding articles of the legal act are given. The way how the cited requirements apply to so specification is described under the testing method.

In addition to the requirements included in ISDSS Regulation this Technical guideline contains TG requirements too. TG requirements are technical provisions that need to be fulfilled in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement when the specific technical implementation proposed in this document is used. Such requirements relate for example to the default encoding described in section 9. *Part 2* of the ATS presents tests necessary for assessing the *conformity with TG requirements*.

NOTE Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in this ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

The *ATS is applicable to the data sets that* *have been transformed* to be made available through INSPIRE download services (i.e. the data returned as a response to the mandatory "Get Spatial Dataset" operation) rather than the original "source" data sets.

The requirements to be tested are grouped in several _conformance classes_. Each of these classes covers a specific aspect: one conformance class contains tests reflecting the requirements on the application schema, another on the reference systems, etc. *Each conformance class is identified by a URI* (uniform resource identifier) according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/so/<conformance class identifier

EXAMPLE 1 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/ef/rs_ identifies the Reference Systems ISDSS conformance class of the Environmental Monitoring Facilities (EF) data theme.

The results of the tests should be published referring to the relevant conformance class (using its URI).

When an INSPIRE data specification contains *more than one application schema,* the requirements tested in a conformance class may differ depending on the application schema used as a target for the transformation of the data set. This will always be the case for the application schema conformance class. However, also other conformance classes could have different requirements for different application schemas. In such cases, a separate conformance class is defined for each application schema, and they are distinguished by specific URIs according to the following pattern:

http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/so/<conformance class identifier>/ 
application schema namespace prefix

EXAMPLE 2 The URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/el/as/el-vec_ identifies the conformity with the application schema (_as_) conformance class for the Elevation Vector Elements (_el-vec_) application schema.

An overview of the conformance classes and the associated tests is given in the table below.

In order to be conformant to a conformance class, a data set has to pass *all* tests defined for that conformance class.

In order to be conformant with the ISDSS regulation the inspected data set needs to be conformant to *all* conformance classes in Part 1. The conformance class for overall conformity with the ISDSS regulation is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/ir/so/._

In order to be conformant with the Technical Guidelines, the dataset under inspection needs to be conformant to all conformance classes included both in Part 1 and 2. Chapter 8 describes in detail how to publish the result of testing regarding overall conformity and conformity with the conformance classes as metadata. The conformance class for overall conformity with the Technical Guidelines is identified by the URI _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/conformance-class/tg/so/3.0._

It should be noted that data providers are not obliged to integrate / decompose the original structure of the source data sets when they deliver them for INSPIRE. It means that a conformant dataset can contain less or more spatial object / data types than specified in the ISDSS Regulation.

*A dataset that contains less spatial object and/or data types* can be regarded conformant when the corresponding types of the source datasets after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation.

A *dataset that contain more spatial object and/or data types* may be regarded as conformant when

* all the spatial object / data types that have corresponding types in the source dataset after the necessary transformations fulfil the requirements set out in the ISDSS Regulation and
* all additional elements of the source model (spatial object types, data types, attributes, constraints, code lists and enumerations together with their values) do not conflict with any rule defined in the interoperability target specifications defined for any theme within INSPIRE.

|===
*Open issue 6*: Even though the last condition can be derived from Art. 8(4) of the Directive, the ISDSS Regulation does not contain requirements concerning the above issue. Therefore, no specific tests have been included in this abstract suite for testing conformity of extended application schemas. Annex F of the Generic Conceptual Model (D2.5) provides an example how to extend INSPIRE application schemas in a compliant way.
|===

The ATS contains a detailed list of abstract tests. It should be noted that some tests in the Application schema conformance class can be automated by utilising xml *schema validation tools.* It should be noted that failing such validation test does not necessary reflect non-compliance to the application schema; it may be the results of erroneous encoding.

Each test in this suite follows the same structure:

* Requirement: citation from the legal texts (ISDSS requirements) or the Technical Guidelines (TG requirements);
* Purpose: definition of the scope of the test;
* Reference: link to any material that may be useful during the test;
* Test method: description of the testing procedure.

According to ISO 19105:2000 all tests in this ATS are basic tests. Therefore, this statement is not repeated each time.

=== _Agri-Environmental Indicator – Soil Erosion_

The European Council requested the Commission to report on the integration of environmental dimensions into Community sectoral policies. As a contribution to meeting this requirement for the agricultural sector, a list of agri-environmental indicators was initially developed with two Commission Communications in 2000 and 2001.

To improve, develop and compile at the appropriate geographical level the indicators identified then, the IRENA (Indicator Reporting on the integration of Environmental concerns into Agricultural policy) project was launched. It was a collaborative effort between the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development (DG AGRI), the Directorate-General for Environment (DG ENV), Eurostat, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the European Environment Agency (EEA) which was responsible for the co-ordination. The results of the IRENA operation were as a set of 42 indicators and sub-indicators and their 40 fact sheets for EU-15.

Following up the IRENA project, the Commission adopted the final list of 28 indicators in a Communication of 2006 ("Development of agri-environmental indicators for monitoring the integration of environmental concerns into the common agricultural policy"). The approach outlined in this Communication was endorsed by the Council. 

Important to note is that the Communication says:" ... In this respect, the full involvement and commitment of the Member States, which are ultimately responsible for data collection, is necessary."

The same five partner institutions have agreed to develop and maintain this system of agri-environmental indicators and laid down the basis for cooperation in a Memorandum of Understanding.(see _http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/agri_environmental_indicators/introduction/history_partners_)

The indicators are currently under development by the five partners which make proposals that are then commented and approved by Member States in consultation meetings. In a sub-sequent operational phase, Eurostat will be responsible for the collection of the data from Member States.

How this will happen and at which level of detail (in the NUTS) still has to be decided.

One of the indicators is "soil erosion", defined as annual soil erosion risk by water.

The model proposed by JRC for the computation of this indicator is RUSLE. This is not consolidated yet.

RUSLE stands for Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation and, with a widespread acceptance, has become a major soil conservation planning tool in many countries in the world.

RUSLE and USLE can be expressed as follows A = R * K * L * S * C * P

Where

A = estimated average soil loss in tons per acre per year
R = rainfall-runoff erosivity factor
K = soil erodibility factor
L = slope length factor
S = slope steepness factor
C = cover-management factor
P = support practice factor

*Mapping of this Use Case with the INSPIRE soil model of DS version 3.0*

*INPUT DATA*

This quite general Use Case relies on the following soil *input* data:

* Soil texture (as %clay, %silt, %sand)
* soil structure (expressed as a combination of class and type)
* soil permeability (e.g. in Darcy)
* soil organic matter (e.g. in %)

Since this use case is about 'soil erosion' modelled with RUSLE, it is assumed that these soil data need to be known for a limited depth of the soil (topsoil).

The required data input format could be point/vector maps or raster maps.

*In case of point or vector maps*, the input data should be provided through datasets that are collections of the objects _SoilDerivedObject_; the latter may or may not take into consideration data coming from possibly associated objects _ObservedSoilProfile_ and/or _SoilBody_ and/or other _SoilDerivedObject-s._

Each input dataset is a composition of __SoilDerivedObject__s and is documented in its associated metadata, that includes a title, abstract and would point to the documentation on how the computation for the input data has been accomplished, eventually relying on data coming from observed soil profiles and/or soil bodies.

Each _SoilDerivedObject_ carries a geometry (could be a point or a polygon) and carries (through the association _soilDerivedObjectObservation_ with an OM_Observation object) a parameter with a given value. The parameter is selected from the codelist _SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue_; note that this code list can be extended by the data provider when needed. For the exact mechanism, see Chapter 5. Note that this mechanism allows also to specifiy the 'unit of measure' and that the type of values include: single numerical values (Number), ranges of numerical values (RangeType), and qualitative values (CharacterString).

For the considered soil input data: name, unit of measure and value would be:

* _soil_texture_clay_, percentage, numeric value or parameterRange
* _soil_texture_silt_, percentage, numeric value or parameterRange
* _soil_texture_sand_, percentage, numeric value or parameterRange
* _soil_strucure_class_, no unit of measure, qualitative value (character string)
* _soil_structure_type_, no unit of measure, qualitative value (character string)
* _soil_permeability_, Darcy, numeric value or parameterRange
* _soil_organic_matter_, percentage, numeric value or parameterRange

Note that in order to give the name of the parameter as a value from the _SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue_ codelist, the codelist should be extended by the user.

Note that, since the parameters _soilDerivedObject_ are linked (through the O&M framework) to _OM_Observation_, which in turn is associated to _INSPIRE_OM_Process_, it is possible to provide additional information on the process that led to observation values. An example of such supplementary information could be the soil depth range for which the value of the _soilDerivedObjectParameter_ is valid.

*In case of raster input maps:.*

The input data take the form of _SoilThemeCoverage_'s, which allows the storage of raster data. The attribute _soilThemeParameter_ is of the datatype _SoilThemeParameterType_ that consists of a _soilThemeParameterName_ (to be taken from the codelist _SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue_ and a unit of measure). The values of the gridcells are covered by a rangeSet constraint that says that values shall be of one of the types Number; RangeType or CharacterString.

Unlike the _SoilDerivedObject_'s (where an input dataset could be specified by indicating its contributing data), the input coverages are in essence standalone, although in theory they can be associated to other coverages through the association with zero or more SoilThemeDescriptiveCoverage's that have the same spatial and domain extent as the associated SoilThemeCoverage..

As for the collections of _SoilDerivedObject_ the raster maps are documented in its associated metadata.

*OUTPUT DATA*

This Use Case produces as *output* data "soil erosion" which can be expressed in tonnes per ha and per year. The output format could be point, vector maps or raster maps.

*In case of point or vector maps*, the output data should be provided through a collection of objects _SoilDerivedObject_; the latter may or may not take into consideration data coming from possibly associated objects _ObservedSoilProfile_ and/or _SoilBody_, although in this Use Case, the _SoilDerivedObject_ should be based on data that are in other _SoilDerivedObject-s, like the input data defined above_

As for the input datasets, the metadata associated to the collection of _SoilDerivedObjects_ (dataset) is documented in its associated metadata that includes a title, abstract and would point to the documentation on how the computation for the output data has been accomplished.

Each _SoilDerivedObject_ in the collection carries a geometry (could be a point or a polygon) and carries (through the association _soilDerivedObjectObservation_ with an OM_Observation object) a parameter with a given value. The parameter is selected from the codelist _SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue, thus this codelist should be extended with a 'soil_erosion' entry_;. _Unit of measure should be_ indicated as "t/ha/year" and the type of value could be a numeric value or parameterRange). Alternatively, if a qualitative indication is desired, the unit of measure should be empty and the value should be a character string.

Similar remarks as for the input data concerning extension of the _SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue codelist_ and the provision of supplementary information through an associated _INSPIRE_OM_Process_ object hold__.__

*In case of an output raster map:*

The output data take the form of a _SoilThemeCoverage_, which allows the storage of raster data. (the same discussion as above for input data holds).

=== _Agri-Environmental Indicator – Soil Quality_

The European Council requested the Commission to report on the integration of environmental dimensions into Community sectoral policies. As a contribution to meeting this requirement for the agricultural sector, a list of agri-environmental indicators was initially developed with two Commission Communications in 2000 and 2001.

How this will happen and at which level of detail (in the NUTS) still has to be decided.

The proposed indicator "soil quality" provides an account of the ability of soil to provide agri-environmental services through its capacities to perform its functions and respond to external influences.

In the agri-environmental context, soil quality describes:

* the capacity of soil to biomass production
* the input-need to attain optimal productivity
* the soil response to climatic variability
* carbon storage; filtering; buffering capacity

The main indicator is 'agri-environmental soil quality index', derived from four supporting indicators:

* productivity index
* fertilizer response rate
* production stability index
* soil environmental quality index

This quite general Use Case relies on the following soil *input* data:

* available water capacity (e.g. as percentage or as a depth (cm))
* rooting depth (e.g. as cm)

=== _Progress in management of Contaminated sites (CSI 015) indicator_

*Narrative explanation of the use case*

For many years, the EEA has been active in the development of indicators in relation to 'contaminated sites'. The term 'contaminated site' refers to a well-delimited area where the presence of *soil contamination* has been confirmed. After many meetings and discussions with representatives from Member States, one possible indicator was defined and agreed upon: "Progress in management of contaminated sites (CSI 015)". Although it is related to soil, the indicator does not require soil data as such.

In 2008, the responsibility for data collection related to this indicator from Member States, passed from EEA to JRC.

*Detailed structured description of the Use Case*
For the TWG _Soil_, the EEA Indicator CSI015 "Progress in the Management of Contaminated Sites" was investigated as a candidate for a Use Case.
As this indicator does not use actual contaminated sites data, but only statistical data in association with the number and status of contaminated site and with the progress in cleaning-up contaminated sites in a country, the TWG decided not to retain it in the list of suitable Use Cases.

*Mapping of this Use Case with the INSPIRE soil model of DS3.0*

This Use Case does not use actual contaminated sites data, therefore can not be mapped to the INSPIRE soil model version 3.0

=== _Land Irrigation Suitability for Navarre (Spain)_

This Use Case explains the system followed in Navarre (Spain) for establishing the land irrigation suitability maps at a scale of 1:25.000.

Irrigation projects generally involve costly inputs and improvements, such as engineering works, irrigation and drainage networks, land clearing and levelling, and others. The estimation of the irrigation capacity of the land is basic for the development plans of a region, taking into account that the irrigated lands are the most productive ones, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions.

The essential parameters to consider in an irrigation suitability assessment are: climate, soil, drainage, hydrology, topography, vegetation, as well as, economic, social and political reasons. Therefore, a multidisciplinary team is needed for a regional irrigation project plan.

One of these actors in Navarre is the Department of Rural Development and Environment of the Government of Navarre, who is in charge, together with Tracasa, of the elaboration of the land irrigation suitability map from a soil point of view. This team decided to employ an adapted version of the USBR (United States Reclamation Bureau) land classification system. This system recognizes 7 land classes:

* Class 1: Arable lands, suitable for irrigated farming, without use limitations.
* Class 2: Arable lands, suitable for irrigated farming, with slight limitations.
* Class 3: Arable lands, suitable for irrigated farming, with moderate limitations.
* Class 4: Arable lands, suitable for a fixed irrigated farming and employing special irrigation systems, with high limitations.
* Class 5: A class requiring special reports to establish whether it is suitable or not for irrigation.
* Class 6: Arable lands, non-suitable for irrigated farming or non-arable lands.
* Class IU: Non-productive lands.

Subclasses indicate the reason for the land being downgraded to a lower class. These deficiencies are related to soil, topography and/or farm drainage:

* *Soil*: effective depth and texture, carbonate content, stoniness, sodicity and salinity, in the superficial horizon and/or control section.
* *Topography*: slope.
* *Drainage*: ground water table depth and impermeable layer depth.

_Soil_ cartographic units are reclassified according to the parameters above mentioned as it is shown in Figure 1. Afterwards, this information is intersected with the land cover and slope map (*Figure 2*) and the product is the "Land irrigation suitability map" at a scale of 1:25.000. For these automated GIS processes a suite of applications (Geobide) have been specifically designed in Tracasa.

The "Land irrigation suitability map" is made at a scale of 1:25.000, therefore, and depending on the case, for further and more detailed information, additional works should be carried out.

2+|*Use Case Description*
|*Name* |Land irrigation suitability in Navarre (Spain).
|*Priority* |Medium
|*Description* a|
Land irrigation suitability maps in Navarre (1:25.000) are elaborated following the methodology proposed by the USBR (Unites States Bureau of Reclamation), but adapted to the specific conditions of Navarre (Spain). The objective is to classify the land according to soil properties, topography, drainage and land cover. From the reclassification of this information and its intersection in GIS land irrigation suitability maps are obtained.
These maps are elaborated employing a suite of applications specifically designed for that purpose (Geobide) and are finally published in a viewer.
|*Legal Foundation* |No legal base.
|*Pre-condition* |None.

|*End-users* |Governmental bodies and public institutions, farmers, collective irrigation organisations...
|*Information provider(s)* |Tracasa, Government of Navarre.
|*Information processors(s)/Brokers* |Tracasa, Government of Navarre.
2+|*Flow of Events – Basic Path*
|*Step 1* |A soil map of a certain area is elaborated: field work, photointerpretation and map edition processes are made.
|*Step 2* a|
The soil mapping units (SMU) are reclassified according to soil, topography and drainage properties.
*Soil*: effective depth and texture, carbonate content, stoniness, sodicity and salinity, in the superficial horizon and/or control section (the most limiting factor between both the superficial horizon and control section is the one taken into account).
*Topography*: slope.
*Drainage*: ground water table depth and impermeable layer depth.
The methodology used for this reclassification is an adaptation for Navarre based on the one proposed by the USBR.
This reclassification is automatically done by an own application, which takes into account, from all the surveys done in each Soil Cartographic Unit for a studied area, all these parameters above mentioned.
|*Step 3* |A slope map based on the DTM25 is elaborated according to 7 range values.
|*Step 4* |The reclassified soil map and slope map are intersected in GIS using the application Geobide.
|*Step 5* |The land cover map is reclassified according to 3 uses: forestry, arable land and non-productive land.
|*Step 6* |The reclassified land cover map is intersected in GIS with the soil-slope cross-map (Geobide).
|*Step 7* |The land irrigation suitability classes and subclasses' map is obtained. Its mapping units contain information about their limiting factor (soil, topography and/or drainage).
|*Step 8* a|
After getting into groups the previous subclasses into classes, the land irrigation suitability classes' map is obtained. The legend of this product is the following one (no information on the limiting factor is reflected):
*Class 1*: Arable lands, suitable for irrigated farming, without use limitations.
*Class 2*: Arable lands, suitable for irrigated farming, with slight limitations.
*Class 3*: Arable lands, suitable for irrigated farming, with moderate limitations.
*Class 4*: Arable lands, suitable for a fixed irrigated farming and employing special irrigation systems, with high limitations.
*Class 5*: A class that requires special reports to establish whether it is suitable or not for irrigation.
*Class 6*: Arable lands, non-suitable for irrigated farming or non-arable lands.
*Class IU*: Non-productive lands.

=== _Development of methodologies for soil salinity surveillance in the middle Ebro basin_

[.text-center]
Subtitle: Development and validation of methodologies based on territorial information systems (remote sensing, GIS, and electromagnetic sensing systems) for identification, prospection and surveillance of salt-affected areas in the middle Ebro basin using information derived from soil maps as ground truth.

The European Commission proposed a framework and common objectives to prevent soil degradation, preserve soil functions and remediate degraded soil (European Thematic Strategy for Soil Protectionfootnote:[Commission Communication of 22 September 2006 entitled "European Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection (ETSSP)" [COM(2006) 231 final - Not published in the Official Journal].] (ETSSP). Under this proposal, risk areas and polluted sites must be identified and provision should be made to remediate degraded soil.

The measures included in the proposal for a Soil Framework Directivefootnote:[Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive of 22 September 2006 setting out a framework for soil protection and amending Council Directive 2004/35/EC. (SDF)] (SFD) include obligatory identification by Member States of areas at risk of erosion, organic matter decline, compaction, *salinization* and landslides, or where the degradation process is already underway. Member States must set objectives and adopt programs of measures to reduce these risks and to address the effects they have.

This Strategy suggests the need to protect the soil, among others, from *_soil salinization_* or the accumulation of soluble salts in the soil at such levels that reduces soil's physical-chemical quality, crop yields and the environmental quality (salinization of surface- and ground-waters).

This use case is part of a Spanish research project (RTA2008-00083-C02-00) under development (2009-2011), entitled "_Soil salinity prospection in the middle Ebro basin and design of its spatial-temporal surveillance through territorial information technologies_". It is a coordinated project with two subprojects, one in Navarra (RTA2008-00083-C02-01; whose main research is Mª Esperanza Amezketa), and another one in Aragón (RTA2008-00083-C02-02; whose main research is Mª Auxiliadora Casterad).

This research project is tackling the more relevant aspects of the ETSSP with respect to soil salinization, with the objective of researching and establishing methodologies for soil salinity survey and appropriate systems for its spatial-temporal surveillance. The study considers, for pre-selected study areas in the middle Ebro basin (Navarra and Aragón), the analysis of the spatial distribution of soil salinity and of the geomorphologic and hydro-geologic factors and processes determining of its development, as well as the design of their spatial-temporal surveillance through territorial information technologies (classical soil prospection, electromagnetic induction sensors associated to global positioning systems-MGES, remote sensing, and geographic information systems). The methodologies are being contrasted, evaluated and adapted to the natural and agrarian landscape. The information that will be generated will contribute to better soil management and soil uses and territory planning, and to the systematizing of soil protection policies required by the current ETSSP and the future SFD.

This project is financially supported by the INIA (Instituto Nacional de Investigación Agraria y Alimentaria, RTA2008-00083-C02-00), the Department of Environment and Rural Development of the Government of Navarra (RTA2008-00083-C02-01), the Ministry of Science and Innovation (Spain) and the European Social Fund (SubProgramme Torres Quevedo, PTQ-08-03-07315).

2+^|*Example 1:*
Using soil map information for stratifying the territory for directing the regional soil salinity survey and calibration with electromagnetic induction sensing systems (EMISS)
This work was done as a pilot study for a very few selected soil cartographic units, in a small study area
Electromagnetic sensors' readings are influenced by the physical and chemical properties of soils. A way for tackling the high variability of those properties is stratifying EMISS prospection and soil sampling as a function of soil-types.

*Flow of Events – Basic Path*
|*Step 1* a|
Use of soil maps to characterize the high variability of soil physical-chemical properties at regional level, to identify soil-types and to stratify the territory.
Use the soil cartographic units (SCU) to direct the soil salinity survey with EMISS (SCU incorporate taxonomic, geomorphic and geologic soil information).
|*Step 2* a|
Selection of some of the most susceptible SCU for presenting salinity problems (according to geographic position, geologic materials, etc) for EMISS prospection and calibration.
Prospection of soil cartographic units (SCU) with EMISS when soil water content is close to field capacity (a few days after some rains or irrigation events).
|*Step 3* a|
Calibration of the sensor (EMISS) to convert the apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) into ECe values.

* Selection of a reduced number of sampling points at each SCU, covering the full range of EMISS readings
* Soil sampling at different depths increments
* Soil analysis: Soil parameters to be analyzed in laboratory:
** Electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract (ECe)
** Soil water content during prospection (%)
** Soil texture (soil saturation percentage, SP)

|*Step 4* a|
Obtaining calibration equations at each selected SCU for assigning soil salinity phases to the EMISS readings:
Four soil salinity classes can be established according to the maximum ECe measured in the soil profiles:



|*Step 5* |Assigning soil salinity phases to EMISS readings for selected SCU: EMISS readings (ECa) must be converted into soil salinity classes according to the calibration equation and to the threshold ECa values equivalent to ECe values of 4, 8 and 16 dS m^-1^.

=== _MARS project_

*Yield forecasting within the MARS project*

For the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy, the European Commission needs timely information on the agricultural production to be expected in the current season. This is a main concern of the MARS-project (Monitoring Agricultural ResourceS). A Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS) has been developed. It is managed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Union (EU) in Ispra, Italy. The aim of the MARS crop yield forecasting system is to provide accurate and timely crop yield forecasts and crop production biomass for the union territory and other strategic areas of the world. The rationale behind the crop forecasts at EU level is based on the lack of timely information to take rapid decision on CAP instruments during the year.

A Crop Forecasting System has been developed and operationally run since 1992 in order to provide timely crop production forecasts at European level. This system is able to monitor crop vegetation growth (cereal, oil seed crops, protein crops, sugar beet, potatoes, pastures, rice) and include the short-term effects of meteorological events on crop productions and to provide yearly yield forecasts on European crops. This system is made by remote sensing and meteorological observations, agro-meteorological modelling (Crop Growth Monitoring System (CGMS), MARS Model Library) and statistical analysis tools.

We focus in this use-case on crop growth monitoring system (CGMS) as it is the system where soil data are used.

The Crop Growth Monitoring System developed by MARS Project provides the European Commission (DG Agriculture) with objective, timely and quantitative yield forecasts at regional and national scale. CGMS monitors crops development in Europe, driven by meteorological conditions modified by soil characteristics and crop parameters. This mechanistic approach describes crop cycle (i.e. biomass, storage organ ...) in combination with phenological development from sowing to maturity on a daily time scale. The main characteristic of CGMS lies in its spatialisation component, integrating interpolated meteorological data, soils and crops parameters, through elementary mapping units used for simulation in the crop model. The core of the system is based on 2 deterministic crop models, WOFOST and LINGRA. GIS tools are used to prepare data and to produce results maps. Input and output are stored in a RDBMS. Statistical procedures are used to forecast quantitative crops yield.

In summary, CGMS consists of three main parts (*Figure 3*):

1. Interpolation of meteorological data to a square grid

2. Simulation of the crop growth

3. Statistical evaluation of the results

The soil data are used in the system in two ways:

** estimation of soil parameters for the crop model: for each STU of SGDBE there is estimation of depth of the soil, water retention at saturation, field capacity and wilting point using PTF. This needs the derived soil profile with its FAO soil name, parent material, depth to textural change, depth of an obstacle to roots, agricultural limitations, topsoil and subsoil texture.
** definition of simulation units: this needs:
(1) soil body area and soil body (with list of derived soil profiles and percentage of area) to overlay with administrative units and meteorological grid
(2) derived soil profile with its FAO soil name and agricultural limitations, depth of an obstacle to roots, depth to impermeable layer, texture, water regime to define crop suitability. If the unit is estimated to be unsuitable for a given crop, then the unit is not used for crop simulation.

=== _Restrictions for agricultural use based on mineral, the N-, and P-saturation in the soil and (shallow) ground water_

For agricultural use of land it is important to know, based on soil classification and soil analysis, what limitations do exist based on the leaching of N and P into the ground water. In the WFD there are thresholds indicating the maximum values allowed. Secondly it is important to know the vulnerability for contamination of the ground water by minerals (N,P) due to agricultural practices in relation to the soil present at that location.

The questions in this use case are:

* What is the vulnerability of leaching of NP due to the values for the relevant properties in the soil?
* What is the maximum level for fertilizer application used by the farmers?

The outcome of this use case is usually a map based on the results of the calculation of the mineral usage, saturation and loss (Model). The model uses in NL are ANIMO and Waterpas

* ANIMO Prediction of Nitrogen and Phosphorus leaching to groundwater and surface waters [http://www.animo.wur.nl/Documents/Report%20983.pdf]
* Waterpas Effects of water management on agriculture [http://meetings.copernicus.org/www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2007/02561/EGU2007-J-02561.pdf]

====
The map shows where restriction zones and limitations are present. This is used for policy, monitoring and enforcing of nature conservation areas and water protection zones
====

To illustrate the specific situation we describe the following on the local scale.

NP application is dispersed on the soil (the fertilising process of the farmer); part of the minerals are tied to organic matter, part is tied to soil minerals, part is taken up by the crop during the growing season. Not all minerals are consumed by the crop, the loss is accumulates in the soil. This accumulation continues until the capacity of the soil is reached. The excess is leached to the deeper out of reach of the roots of the crop and is lost into deeper ground water or is drained via the surface water system. The Nitrogen can also be denitrificated which is vaporized in to the air (NO2). In the WFD the threshold for Nitrate is 25 milligrams/ litre (in the ground water) at a depth of 2 meter.

_Note: similar use case can be defined for other applicants (crop protection chemicals)_

Leaching is determined for nitrate by the pF, the ground water table and the amount of carbon in the soil. For Phosphate by the pH (most important), Fe, Al. (Ferro-aluminium complex)

{empty}* The danger of leaching is very much related to historic land use (farmers spreading too much fertilizer/manure) and soil type characteristics. Consequences of historic land use show in the results of the farmer samples (used for fertilizing advices). These elements can not available in central databases. So you are fully dependent on:

. Statistical data on the use of fertilizers/manure in a region.
. soil data (soil map with underlying soil type characteristics)
. results from regional water monitoring systems showing excesses in the concentrations of NP

=== Calculation threshold trace elements

*Estimation of regional trace elements threshold for anomalous values detection in France*

To determine if a site is polluted or not with trace elements, it is needed to compare the analytical results obtained on samples from the site to the background values of trace elements in the region. Trace elements naturally vary following the soil type and the parent material.

In France, the ministry of environment is in charge of polluted sites. It asks Inra to calculate threshold values using the data from the French soil monitoring network. The threshold values are estimated for 0-30 cm and for 30-50 cm layers on a 16 km by 16 km grid for the following trace elements: Cd total  extractible, Co total, Cr total, Cu total  extractible, Mo total, Ni total  extractible, Pb total  extractible, Th total, Zn total  extractible. For each point of the grid, the estimation is based on the measured values of the 10 neighbouring points within a distance of 50 km for 0-30 cm and 30-50 cm respectively, and the calculation of the third quartile  3x(interquartile range).

The Figure *5* below shows an example from the web site giving the Cd total threshold for 0-30 cm.
