== *How to read the document?*

This document describes the _"INSPIRE data specification on Soil â€“ Technical Guidelines"_ version 3.0 as developed by the Thematic Working Group (TWG) _TWG-Soil_ using both natural and a conceptual schema language.

The data specification is based on a common templatefootnote:[The common document template is available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2] used for all data specifications, which has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I, II and III data specifications.

This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the Implementing Rule for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. It also includes additional requirements and recommendations that, although not included in the Implementing Rule, are relevant to guarantee or to increase data interoperability.

Two executive summaries provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on _Soil_ in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first.

The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of _Soil_, but also to other stakeholders and users of the spatial data infrastructure.

The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes.

In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the spatial object types, the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in _italics._

== *Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services â€“ General Executive Summary*

The challenges regarding the lack of availability, quality, organisation, accessibility, and sharing of spatial information are common to a large number of policies and activities and are experienced across the various levels of public authority in Europe. In order to solve these problems it is necessary to take measures of coordination between the users and providers of spatial information. The Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council adopted on 14 March 2007 aims at establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) for environmental policies, or policies and activities that have an impact on the environment.

INSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created and maintained by the Member States. To support the establishment of a European infrastructure, Implementing Rules addressing the following components of the infrastructure have been specified: metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets (as described in Annexes I, II, III of the Directive) and spatial data services, network services, data and service sharing, and monitoring and reporting procedures.

INSPIRE does not require collection of new data. However, after the period specified in the Directivefootnote:[For all 34 Annex I,II and III data themes: within two years of the adoption of the corresponding Implementing Rules for newly collected and extensively restructured data and within 5 years for other data in electronic format still in use] Member States have to make their data available according to the Implementing Rules.

Interoperability in INSPIRE means the possibility to combine spatial data and services from different sources across the European Community in a consistent way without involving specific efforts of humans or machines. It is important to note that "interoperability" is understood as providing access to spatial data sets through network services, typically via Internet. Interoperability may be achieved by either changing (harmonising) and storing existing data sets or transforming them via services for publication in the INSPIRE infrastructure. It is expected that users will spend less time and efforts on understanding and integrating data when they build their applications based on data delivered in accordance with INSPIRE.

In order to benefit from the endeavours of international standardisation bodies and organisations established under international law their standards and technical means have been utilised and referenced, whenever possible.

To facilitate the implementation of INSPIRE, it is important that all stakeholders have the opportunity to participate in specification and development. For this reason, the Commission has put in place a consensus building process involving data users, and providers together with representatives of industry, research and government. These stakeholders, organised through Spatial Data Interest Communities (SDIC) and Legally Mandated Organisations (LMO)footnote:[The current status of registered SDICs/LMOs is available via INSPIRE website: http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/42], have provided reference materials, participated in the user requirement and technicalfootnote:[Surveys on unique identifiers and usage of the elements of the spatial and temporal schema,] surveys, proposed experts for the Data Specification Drafting Teamfootnote:[The Data Specification Drafting Team has been composed of experts from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, UK, and the European Environment Agency], the Thematic Working Groupsfootnote:[The Thematic Working Groups have been composed of experts from Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, the European Environment Agency and the European Commission.] and other ad-hoc cross-thematic technical groups and participated in the public stakeholder consultations on draft versions of the data specifications. These consultations covered expert reviews as well as feasibility and fitness-for-purpose testing of the data specificationsfootnote:[For Annex IIIII, the consultation and testing phase lasted from 20 June to 21 October 2011.].

This open and participatory approach was successfully used during the development of the data specifications on Annex I, II and III data themes as well as during the preparation of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[Commission Regulation (EU) NoÂ 1089/2010 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:323:SOM:EN:HTML[implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards interoperability of spatial data sets and services,] published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 8^th^ of December 2010.] for Annex I spatial data themes and of its amendment regarding the themes of Annex II and III.

The development framework elaborated by the Data Specification Drafting Team aims at keeping the data specifications of the different themes coherent. It summarises the methodology to be used for the development of the data specifications, providing a coherent set of requirements and recommendations to achieve interoperability. The pillars of the framework are the following technical documentsfootnote:[The framework documents are available in the "Framework documents" section of the data specifications web page at http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.cfm/pageid/2]:

* The _Definition of Annex Themes and Scope_ describes in greater detail the spatial data themes defined in the Directive, and thus provides a sound starting point for the thematic aspects of the data specification development.
* The _Generic Conceptual Model_ defines the elements necessary for interoperability and data harmonisation including cross-theme issues. It specifies requirements and recommendations with regard to data specification elements of common use, like the spatial and temporal schema, unique identifier management, object referencing, some common code lists, etc. Those requirements of the Generic Conceptual Model that are directly implementable are included in the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services.
* The _Methodology for the Development of Data Specifications_ defines a repeatable methodology. It describes how to arrive from user requirements to a data specification through a number of steps including use-case development, initial specification development and analysis of analogies and gaps for further specification refinement.
* The _Guidelines for the Encoding of Spatial Data_ defines how geographic information can be encoded to enable transfer processes between the systems of the data providers in the Member States. Even though it does not specify a mandatory encoding rule it sets GML (ISO 19136) as the default encoding for INSPIRE.
* The _Guidelines for the use of Observations & Measurements and Sensor Web Enablement-related standards in INSPIRE Annex II and III data specification development_ provides guidelines on how the "Observations and Measurements" standard (ISO 19156) is to be used within INSPIRE.
* The _Common data models_ are a set of documents that specify data models that are referenced by a number of different data specifications. These documents include generic data models for networks, coverages and activity complexes.

The structure of the data specifications is based on the "ISO 19131 Geographic information - Data product specifications" standard. They include the technical documentation of the application schema, the spatial object types with their properties, and other specifics of the spatial data themes using natural language as well as a formal conceptual schema languagefootnote:[UML â€“ Unified Modelling Language].

A consolidated model repository, feature concept dictionary, and glossary are being maintained to support the consistent specification development and potential further reuse of specification elements. The consolidated model consists of the harmonised models of the relevant standards from the ISO 19100 series, the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model, and the application schemasfootnote:[Conceptual models related to specific areas (e.g. INSPIRE themes)] developed for each spatial data theme. The multilingual INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary contains the definition and description of the INSPIRE themes together with the definition of the spatial object types present in the specification. The INSPIRE Glossary defines all the terms (beyond the spatial object types) necessary for understanding the INSPIRE documentation including the terminology of other components (metadata, network services, data sharing, and monitoring).

By listing a number of requirements and making the necessary recommendations, the data specifications enable full system interoperability across the Member States, within the scope of the application areas targeted by the Directive. The data specifications (in their version 3.0) are published as technical guidelines and provide the basis for the content of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Servicesfootnote:[In the case of the Annex IIIII data specifications, the extracted requirements are used to formulate an amendment to the existing Implementing Rule.]. The content of the Implementing Rule is extracted from the data specifications, considering short- and medium-term feasibility as well as cost-benefit considerations. The requirements included in the Implementing Rule are legally binding for the Member States according to the timeline specified in the INSPIRE Directive.

In addition to providing a basis for the interoperability of spatial data in INSPIRE, the data specification development framework and the thematic data specifications can be reused in other environments at local, regional, national and global level contributing to improvements in the coherence and interoperability of data in spatial data infrastructures.

== *_Soil_ â€“ Executive Summary*

For the purpose of the data specification in this document, soil is the upper part of the earth's crust, formed by mineral particles, organic matter, water, air and living organisms. It is the interface between rock, air and water which hosts most of the biosphere. Soil is subject to a series of threats as recognized not only in the EU Soil Thematic Strategy (COM(2006)231 final), but indirectly also in several adopted EU Directives (e.g. 1999/31/EC, 91/676/EEC, 86/278/EC..). The requirements of these directives were considered while compiling this data specification.

Based on the definition given by the Directive (2007/2/EC), the scope for the soil theme covers:

[loweralpha]
. *Soil inventories*, providing one-off assessments of soil conditions and/or soil properties at certain locations and at a specific point in time, and allow soil monitoring, providing a series of assessments showing how soil conditions and/or properties change over time.
. *Soil mapping*, providing a spatial presentation of the properties linked to the soils, including soil types; typically, soil maps are derived with the help of data available in soil inventories. Also other soil related information derived from soil properties, possibly in combination with non-soil data are within the scope.

The INSPIRE methodology was used (D2.6). The input from the Member States was used for defining 15 Use cases covering Agro-Environmental Indicators, Soil Derived Information, Contaminated sites and Soil Monitoring (see Annex B). Based on these Use cases, together with the expert knowledge present in the thematic working group (TWG), the data model was built and validated.

The comments from the Member State consultation and the testing were used to improve the data model.

The data model contains a core set of spatial object types and their attributes that are considered to be essential for the infrastructure along which data on soil can be exchanged. In addition to the core _Soil_ data model an extension data model (including application schema) deals with the management of soil contamination (see Annex D). This model extension demonstrates how the core _Soil_ data model can be extended to include more specific requirements (soil contamination) that were identified by the Use cases.

The TWG has also prepared an example of how a soil derived theme - soil organic carbon - can be provided utilising the core _Soil_ data model. (see Annex D)

The soil observable parameters relevant for some approved EU Directives are included in the model in the spatial object types SoilProfile, ProfileElement, SoilDerivedObject and SoilThemeCoverage.

The data specification is based, as far as possible, on existing standards. Apart from general ISO19xxx standards used in relation to geographical information, use was also made of the ISO DIS 28258 (Draft International Standard/Soil Quality) standard. As soil contains many observable and measurable parameters, the specialised use of the ISO 19156:2011 Observations and Measurements standard is proposed. Based on the soil community practise to provide thematic soil map information in a raster form, this option is provided for by utilising the ISO 19123 Coverages standard.

To enhance semantic interoperability the use of the soil classification scheme WRB (World Reference Base for Soil Resources) and the FAO horizon notation scheme as primary classification systems are proposed. The use of other currently used (local, regional, national) classification systems is also provided for.

== Scope

This document specifies a harmonised data specification for the spatial data theme _Soil_ as defined in Annex III of the INSPIRE Directive.

This data specification provides the basis for the drafting of Implementing Rules according to Article 7 (1) of the INSPIRE Directive [Directive 2007/2/EC]. The entire data specification is published as implementation guidelines accompanying these Implementing Rules.

== Overview

=== Name

INSPIRE data specification for the theme _Soil_.

=== Informal description

*Definition:*

Soils and subsoil characterised according to depth, texture, structure and content of particles and organic material, stoniness, erosion, where appropriate mean slope and anticipated water storage capacity. [Directive 2007/2/EC]

*Description:*

Soil is a non-renewable resource at the human scale, which is important for many parts of society. In many places in the world, soil degradation is a serious process threatening that soil can fulfil its functions in the future. In the climate change debate, soil is becoming important in relation to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Soil degradation may result in soils that no longer can fulfil services like food production, or being so contaminated that they form a threat for human and/or ecological health.

Soil is subject to a series of threats as recognized in the EU Soil Thematic Strategy (COM(2006)231 final): erosion, organic matter decline, contamination, salinisation, sodification, compaction, soil biodiversity loss, sealing, landslides and flooding. Also soil acidification is generally considered to be a problem in humid areas. Information on soils is crucial to make fundamental decisions and to protect the soil against degradation processes.

The need for soil information can vary from improvement of agricultural and forestry production, prevention of environment damage due to human activities, or to getting to know the location and extent of sites with high concentrations of harmful substances. There is a high demand for soil information in relation to carbon sequestration (climate change), the prevention of soil degradation, improvement of agricultural production (e.g. food and bio-energy crops) and for the mitigation of desertification in areas with arid and semi-arid climatic conditions.

In order to provide meaningful use and to share and exchange information in the field of soil, part of the world of soil (seen as a Universe of Discourse (UoD)) is to be modelled. The soil UoD is defined and limited by the problems that need to be solved and the solutions that are to be provided through the use of soil information. The kind of soil information is suggested by Use Cases (preferably underpinned by legislation) that have been identified by the TWG-SO based on input from INSPIRE stakeholders and by the expertise available in the expert group.

The following use cases are identified and described in Annex B:

* *Agri-Environmental Indicators:*
** Use Case Environmental Indicator Soil Erosion
** Use Case Environmental Indicator Soil Quality
** Use Case Environmental Indicator Contaminated Sites
* *Thematic maps derived from soil information*
** Land irrigation suitability in Navarra (Spain)
** Development of methodologies for soil salinity surveillance in the middle Ebro basin (Spain)
** Monitoring Agricultural ResourceS (MARS) project
** Restrictions for N and P in agriculture
** Calculation threshold trace elements
** Use of Soil Scape Viewer
** Establishment Less Favoured Areas (France)
* *Contaminated sites*
** Contaminated Land Register Austria
** Use Case drinking water and soil contamination
** Use Case Ecology and contamination
** Use Case Property and contamination
* *Soil Monitoring*
** Use Case state of soil in Europe

To show the relevance of known European legislation related to soil, the Use Cases were cross-checked with the legislation at hand; where there is a common interest or overlap on data used, it is indicated in the following table:

image::./media/table_page_12.png[image,width=802,height=943, align=center]

NOTE none of the directives is considered as a use case in itself.

Based on the mentioned Use Cases and on the TWG-SO expertise, the following relevant and general uses for soil information were identified:

* For using the spatial distribution of soils and their properties, data that allow the creation of maps (at various scales) on the distribution of soil types and soil properties are needed. Such data are based on data taken from soil profiles, soil observations and soil samples (taken on soil sites at soil plots), which in combination with human expertise and/or automated procedures can be interpreted such that physical real world areas, which show certain soil characteristics, can be delineated, depending on the scale considered, and named here as soil bodies. Hence structuring soil data and the possibility for mapping them are included.
* Over time, important soil characteristics (e.g. content of organic carbon, soil acidity, etc.) may vary, and it can be required to follow these changes over time. Hence real world 'soil monitoring' is taken into consideration.
* In the context of the EU Soil Thematic Strategy, soil contamination is considered as one of the major threats to soil, at the local scale (contaminated sites); at large area scale (diffuse soil contamination, usually low level and dispersed by deposition from air, by groundwater or by agricultural practices) and at the level of brownfields (regions with many contaminated sites and usually combined with diffuse contamination). An attempt is made to include a generic approach towards some aspects of soil contamination (see Annex D).

The INSPIRE themes _Soil_ and Geology show some overlap regarding the real world objects they describe, but often see them under different perspectives (*Figure 1*). For the soil domain, rock is the parent material of any soil development, and as such geogenic layers are included in soil datasets. Nonetheless, rock types and their genesis can be named in the same way as in the domain of geology. Hence, the code lists to characterize lithology, processes and process environments have been agreed upon by the INSPIRE Thematic Working Groups Geology and _Soil_. As the superficial layers in which soils develop are not considered in geological datasets throughout, the spatial data from both domains do not necessarily overlap, but kind of complete one another.

[.text-center]
*Figure 1: The field of Pedology seen in relation to the field of Geology.*

On the basis of the previous considerations, the soil theme includes the following phenomena (either in the physical world or conceptualized world):

* soil profiles
* soil sites, soil plots
* soil bodies (delineated areas on the earth's surface determined on the basis of certain soil characteristics)
* soil characteristics (parameters) that change over time (possibly allowing soil monitoring)

Considering these soil related phenomena, an object model is constructed in the form of a UML class diagram. Information exchange structured according to this model, originating from different providers, will be structurally interoperable and provide a possible way for meaningful exchange of soil information.

A model was developed consisting of a core of objects, their interrelations and attributes; they are considered to be essential; this model is the basis for further INSPIRE legislation.

However, as exemplified by some of the described Use Cases, the objects of the model do not fully allow for the implementation of certain uses and purposes. The need for modelling of soil data beyond this model is accommodated by the possibility of creating extensions to it. In this document, the implementation of a kind of extension is demonstrated for a Use Case on soil contamination and content of soil organic carbon (see Annex D).

In the following, the structuring of the elements and concepts of the soil domain as model-objects and attributes is described. It should be noted that many elements of the European Soil Geographical Data Base and other international initiatives related to the standardization and exchange of soil data have been taken into account. The names given to the objects, attributes and associations are as neutral as possible i.e. not deliberately taken from existing, specific nomenclature.

[.text-center]
*Figure 2: Soil profile layer and horizon located in a soil plot.*

*Soil Profiles*

The real world concept "soil profile" (*_SoilProfile_* class in the model) (illustrated by *Figure 2*) can be defined as a cross-section of the soil from the surface down to and including the beginning of the fresh material unmodified by pedogenesis, consisting of various more or less horizontally oriented features formed by pedogenic processes called horizons. Any real world soil profile, considered as a whole, can be characterized by a number of properties, such as: its soil type according to a soil classification scheme, its water capacity available for plants, coarse fragment cover, the presence of a water table, etc. Soil horizons within a profile possess biological, physical and chemical characteristics which differ from the horizons above and beneath and are distinguished principally by texture, colour, structure, chemical composition, and their biomass. The chemical properties may include concentrations in the solid, water and air phases, mobility and soil adsorption capacities. A profile can additionally be described with layers (instead of being described with horizons) which do not necessarily correspond with pedo-genetically formed horizons. Such layers can be fixed depths intervals of sampling, top- and subsoil, or geogenic layers. Layers and horizons are considered both as profile elements in the model as they are both horizontal subdivisions of the soil profile.

The real world concept "observed soil profile" (*_ObservedSoilProfile_* object in the model) represents a soil profile *physically* located in a soil plot (or exposed with a boring), described in the field, possibly sampled and analysed in the laboratory. An observed soil profile refers to a real world location (specified by an associated soil plot).

image::./media/image6.png[image,width=468,height=370, align=center]

[.text-center]
*Figure 3: Soil profiles, soil bodies.*

A "derived soil profile" (*_DerivedSoilProfile_* object in the model) is a soil profile that cannot be located in a soil plot. It corresponds to the spatial extent of a soil type that has been observed in one or several observed soil profiles. The derived soil profile has property values that could be derived (e.g. averaged) from the values of the corresponding properties of one or more observed soil profiles. The derived soil profile can be characterized by the same properties as those of the observed soil profiles, but it is understood that the values for these properties have been derived or determined by expert judgment or calculation. A derived soil profile can be seen as a characterisation of a Soil Typological Unit (STU), or Series, as recognized in the European Soil Geographical Database and other soil databases at national or regional levels. A derived soil profile is not necessarily linked to observed soil profiles, in which case it represents a hypothetical soil profile.

*Soil delineated areas*

To delineate spatially an area that is characterized by a set of such derived soil profiles, the model introduces the construct of "soil body" (*_SoilBody_* object in the model) which represents an association (or other types of spatial interlinkages of various soil types) of soils that are found together in the area. Soils forming the soil body are described using derived soil profiles. The soil body can be represented by one or more derived soil profiles, giving an impression of the properties of the soil body as a whole. This is modelled by linking derived soil profiles to the soil body, indicating their area share, expressed in percentages or percentage ranges (see *Figure 3*). Note that the exact location of each kind of soil type within the soil body is unknown; only the area (geometry) of the soil body is known and also how much of this area is covered by each of the soil types (described as derived soil profiles) in that area. For instance, a soil body could consist of one dominant soil (as described by a derived soil profile) and of other soils (described by other derived soil profiles) having characteristics different from the dominant one. The label of a soil body allows a description of it, which may be useful for building legends. A soil body can be interpreted as a Soil Mapping Unit (SMU) as recognized in the European Soil Geographical Data Base and other soil databases at national or regional levels.

In the context of the model, a *_SoilDerivedObject_* object is defined as a spatial object representing a soil related property which value could, for instance, be derived from values of soil properties of related observed soil profiles and/or related soil bodies (and thus soil derived profiles). A value completely independent of observed soil profiles and soil bodies could be possible as well.

In practice, the derivation of values for the _SoilDerivedObject_ objects could be done from information stored in observed soil profiles and/or soil bodies, or it could also be done from such information in combination with external data. An example of the former could be the calculation of pH or soil organic matter content in the topsoil, based on data found in a set of observed soil profiles. An example of the latter could be the derivation of certain soil related properties (for example soil erosion risk) for which calibrated models are to be used which not only extract and elaborate information from observed soil profiles and/or soil bodies, but also require data that are external to the soil Model (e.g. meteorological and land cover data).

In Annex D an example is given how the model can be extended for a more concrete use case (soil organic carbon content and soil organic carbon stock), both as a coverage and as a vector.

*Soil Site and Soil Plot*

A soil site (*_SoilSite_* object in the model) is considered as a) the surrounding of a soil profile, and/or b) the larger piece of land that is directly linked to and described by all soil investigations on one or more spots, called soil plots. A "soil plot" (*_SoilPlot_* object in the model) is the location of a specific soil investigation (e.g. of a trial pit). Because for many soil investigations the studied soil is destroyed, the soil site provides also the object to which the results of repeated investigations are related and handled as if they were obtained from the very same place. The purpose of the investigation can be of a general nature (e.g. a reconnaissance whereby soil profiles are taken for a general soil characterization) or specific (e.g. a reconnaissance whereby samples are taken to investigate potentially contaminated land); this information can be crucial for data evaluation to identify bias in the selection of sites. A soil plot within a soil site is of a certain type (borehole, trial pit, sample) and located by coordinates and/or the name of that location.

*Soil characteristics that change over time*

There are no explicit constructs foreseen related to soil monitoring. Monitoring, considered as the repeated observation of one or more soil characteristics over time, can be implemented through the use of the various time/date attributes of the objects of the model.

*Soil Contamination*

There are no explicit constructs for soil contamination data in the Model. Contamination is implicitly included by the possibility of specifying contamination parameters for sites, profiles and profile elements. The contaminants are treated here like chemical elements. There are also no explicit constructs included in the model for contaminated sites. For the moment, *as an example* how the model could be extended to deal with soil contaminated sites and site management, a generic Use Case on "Soil â€“ Contamination" is provided in Annex D. Nevertheless, some heavy metal elements are part of a codelist for profile element parameter because they are cited by the directive 86/278/EC as elements to be analysed in agricultural parcels before the application of sewage sludge.

*Note on soil sampling*

In the context of soils two different meanings can be seen for "sample":

On the one hand, the notion of "soil sample", considered as a physical part of the soil for which one or more properties are determined. This notion is not withheld as an explicit construct in the Model.

On the other hand, "sample" is considered to be the location where soil material is taken at a specific depth or over a depth range without doing any soil profile description. "Sample", together with trial pit and borehole, is a type of soil plot. The latter is the concept described in the model.

{empty}NOTE: The ISO DIS 28258 draft standard has been developed in parallel with this data specification on soil. It has a wider scope, but the models mutually influenced each other. In conclusion, as far as both models cover the same real world objects, central terms and definitions in and for the data models are near enough to be mappable into each other.

=== Terms and definitions

General terms and definitions helpful for understanding the INSPIRE data specification documents are defined in the INSPIRE Glossaryfootnote:[The INSPIRE Glossary is available from http://inspire-registry.jrc.ec.europa.eu/registers/GLOSSARY].

Specifically, for the theme _Soil_, the following terms are defined:

*_Soil Body:_* Part of the soil cover that is delineated and that is homogeneous with regard to certain soil properties and/or spatial patterns. It is the real-world correlate of a *_soil mapping unit_*.

*_Derived Soil Profile:_* A non-point-located soil profile that serves as a reference profile for a specific soil type in a certain geographical area. One or more derived soil profiles can represent the information which is combined to so-called *_Soil Typological Units_* (STUs) in some soil mapping approaches.

*_Soil Derived Object_*: A spatial object type for representing spatial objects with soil-related property derived from one or more soil and possibly other non soil properties. It is the real-world correlate of the mapping units of soil property maps which often are derived from the soil map that shows the distribution of soil taxa.

=== How the Technical Guidelines map to the Implementing Rules

The schematic diagram in Figure 4 gives an overview of the relationships between the INSPIRE legal acts (the INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules) and the INSPIRE Technical Guidelines. The INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules include legally binding requirements that describe, usually on an abstract level, _what_ Member States must implement.

In contrast, the Technical Guidelines define _how_ Member States might implement the requirements included in the INSPIRE Implementing Rules. As such, they may include non-binding technical requirements that must be satisfied if a Member State data provider chooses to conform to the Technical Guidelines. Implementing these Technical Guidelines will maximise the interoperability of INSPIRE spatial data sets.

*Figure 4 - Relationship between INSPIRE Implementing Rules and Technical Guidelines*

==== Requirements

The purpose of these Technical Guidelines (Data specifications on _Soil_) is to provide practical guidance for implementation that is guided by, and satisfies, the (legally binding) requirements included for the spatial data theme _Soil_ in the Regulation (Implementing Rules) on interoperability of spatial data sets and services. These requirements are highlighted in this document as follows:

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article / Annex / Section no._
*Title / Heading*

This style is used for requirements contained in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).
====

For each of these IR requirements, these Technical Guidelines contain additional explanations and examples.

NOTE The Abstract Test Suite (ATS) in Annex A contains conformance tests that directly check conformance with these IR requirements.

Furthermore, these Technical Guidelines may propose a specific technical implementation for satisfying an IR requirement. In such cases, these Technical Guidelines may contain additional technical requirements that need to be met in order to be conformant with the corresponding IR requirement _when using this proposed implementation_. These technical requirements are highlighted as follows:

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement X* This style is used for requirements for a specific technical solution proposed in these Technical Guidelines for an IR requirement.
====

NOTE 1 Conformance of a data set with the TG requirement(s) included in the ATS implies conformance with the corresponding IR requirement(s).

NOTE 2 In addition to the requirements included in the Implementing Rules on interoperability of spatial data sets and services, the INSPIRE Directive includes further legally binding obligations that put additional requirements on data providers. For example, Art. 10(2) requires that Member States shall, where appropriate, decide by mutual consent on the depiction and position of geographical features whose location spans the frontier between two or more Member States. General guidance for how to meet these obligations is provided in the INSPIRE framework documents.

==== Recommendations

In addition to IR and TG requirements, these Technical Guidelines may also include a number of recommendations for facilitating implementation or for further and coherent development of an interoperable infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
*Recommendation X* Recommendations are shown using this style.
====

NOTE The implementation of recommendations is not mandatory. Compliance with these Technical Guidelines or the legal obligation does not depend on the fulfilment of the recommendations.

==== Conformance

Annex A includes the abstract test suite for checking conformance with the requirements included in these Technical Guidelines and the corresponding parts of the Implementing Rules (Commission Regulation (EU) No 1089/2010).

<<<
== Specification scopes

This data specification does not distinguish different specification scopes, but just considers one general scope.

NOTE For more information on specification scopes, see [ISO 19131:2007], clause 8 and Annex D.

== Identification information

These Technical Guidelines are identified by the following URI:
http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/tg/so/3.0

NOTE ISO 19131 suggests further identification information to be included in this section, e.g. the title, abstract or spatial representation type. The proposed items are already described in the document metadata, executive summary, overview description (section 2) and descriptions of the application schemas (section 5). In order to avoid redundancy, they are not repeated here.

<<<
== Data content and structure

=== Application schemas â€“ Overview 

==== Application schemas included in the IRs

Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the Implementing Rules lay down the requirements for the content and structure of the data sets related to the INSPIRE Annex themes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 4
*Types for the Exchange and Classification of Spatial Objects*

1. For the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets meeting the conditions laid down in Article 4 of Directive 2007/2/EC, Member States shall use the spatial object types and associated data types, enumerations and code lists that are defined in Annexes II, III and IV for the themes the data sets relate to.

2. Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in the Annexes.

3. The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types shall comply with the definitions and include the values set out in Annex II. The enumeration and code list values are uniquely identified by language-neutral mnemonic codes for computers. The values may also include a language-specific name to be used for human interaction.

====

The types to be used for the exchange and classification of spatial objects from data sets related to the spatial data theme _Soil_ are defined in the following application schema (see section 5.3):

*- Soil* - Soil application schema contains the essential elements of a data model that allow the exchange of geo-referenced soil data.

The application schemas specify requirements on the properties of each spatial object including its multiplicity, domain of valid values, constraints, etc.

NOTE The application schemas presented in this section contain some additional information that is not included in the Implementing Rules, in particular multiplicities of attributes and association roles.

[TIP]
====
*TG Requirement 1*

Spatial object types and data types shall comply with the multiplicities defined for the attributes and association roles in this section.

====

An application schema may include references (e.g. in attributes or inheritance relationships) to common types or types defined in other spatial data themes. These types can be found in a sub-section called "Imported Types" at the end of each application schema section. The common types referred to from application schemas included in the IRs are addressed in Article 3.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 3_
*Common Types*

Types that are common to several of the themes listed in Annexes I, II and III to Directive 2007/2/EC shall conform to the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles set out in Annex I.

====

NOTE Since the IRs contain the types for all INSPIRE spatial data themes in one document, Article 3 does not explicitly refer to types defined in other spatial data themes, but only to types defined in external data models.

Common types are described in detail in the Generic Conceptual Model [DS-D2.7], in the relevant international standards (e.g. of the ISO 19100 series) or in the documents on the common INSPIRE models [DS-D2.10.x]. For detailed descriptions of types defined in other spatial data themes, see the corresponding Data Specification TG document [DS-D2.8.x].

==== Additional recommended application schemas 

In addition to the application schemas listed above, the following additional application schemas have been defined for the theme _Soil_ (see Annex D)

*- Soil Contamination* â€“ SoilContamination application schema demonstrates the extensibility of the core (legally mandated) SOIL data model to the field of the management of soil contaminated land.

These additional application schemas are not included in the IRs. They typically address requirements from specific (groups of) use cases and/or may be used to provide additional information. They are included in this specification in order to improve interoperability also for these additional aspects and to illustrate the extensibility of the application schemas included in the IRs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 1*

Additional and/or use case-specific information related to the theme _Soil_ should be made available using the spatial object types and data types specified in the following application schema(s): SoilContamination,

These spatial object types and data types should comply with the definitions and constraints and include the attributes and association roles defined in the Annex D.

The enumerations and code lists used in attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types should comply with the definitions and include the values defined in the Annex D.

====

=== Basic notions

This section explains some of the basic notions used in the INSPIRE application schemas. These explanations are based on the GCM [DS-D2.5].

==== Notation

===== Unified Modeling Language (UML)

The application schemas included in this section are specified in UML, version 2.1. The spatial object types, their properties and associated types are shown in UML class diagrams.

NOTE For an overview of the UML notation, see Annex D in [ISO 19103].

The use of a common conceptual schema language (i.e. UML) allows for an automated processing of application schemas and the encoding, querying and updating of data based on the application schema â€“ across different themes and different levels of detail.

The following important rules related to class inheritance and abstract classes are included in the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 5
*Types*

(...)

2. Types that are a sub-type of another type shall also include all this type's attributes and association roles.

3. Abstract types shall not be instantiated.

====

The use of UML conforms to ISO 19109 8.3 and ISO/TS 19103 with the exception that UML 2.1 instead of ISO/IEC 19501 is being used. The use of UML also conforms to ISO 19136 E.2.1.1.1-E.2.1.1.4.

NOTE ISO/TS 19103 and ISO 19109 specify a profile of UML to be used in conjunction with the ISO 19100 series. This includes in particular a list of stereotypes and basic types to be used in application schemas. ISO 19136 specifies a more restricted UML profile that allows for a direct encoding in XML Schema for data transfer purposes.

To model constraints on the spatial object types and their properties, in particular to express data/data set consistency rules, OCL (Object Constraint Language) is used as described in ISO/TS 19103, whenever possible. In addition, all constraints are described in the feature catalogue in English, too.

NOTE Since "void" is not a concept supported by OCL, OCL constraints cannot include expressions to test whether a value is a _void_ value. Such constraints may only be expressed in natural language.

===== Stereotypes

In the application schemas in this section several stereotypes are used that have been defined as part of a UML profile for use in INSPIRE [DS-D2.5]. These are explained in Table 1 below.

[.text-center]
*Table 1 â€“ Stereotypes (adapted from [DS-D2.5])*

[align=center,width="100%",cols="22%,14%,64%"]
|===
|*Stereotype* |*Model element* |*Description*
|applicationSchema |Package |An INSPIRE application schema according to ISO 19109 and the Generic Conceptual Model.
|leaf |Package |A package that is not an application schema and contains no packages.
|featureType |Class |A spatial object type.
|type |Class |A type that is not directly instantiable, but is used as an abstract collection of operation, attribute and relation signatures. This stereotype should usually not be used in INSPIRE application schemas as these are on a different conceptual level than classifiers with this stereotype.
|dataType |Class |A structured data type without identity.
|union |Class |A structured data type without identity where exactly one of the properties of the type is present in any instance.
|enumeration |Class |An enumeration.
|codeList |Class |A code list.
|import |Dependency |The model elements of the supplier package are imported.
|voidable |Attribute, association role |A voidable attribute or association role (see section 5.2.2).
|lifeCycleInfo |Attribute, association role |If in an application schema a property is considered to be part of the life-cycle information of a spatial object type, the property shall receive this stereotype.
|version |Association role |If in an application schema an association role ends at a spatial object type, this stereotype denotes that the value of the property is meant to be a specific version of the spatial object, not the spatial object in general.
|===

==== Voidable characteristics

The Â«voidableÂ» stereotype is used to characterise those properties of a spatial object that may not be present in some spatial data sets, even though they may be present or applicable in the real world. This does _not_ mean that it is optional to provide a value for those properties.

For all properties defined for a spatial object, a value has to be provided â€“ either the corresponding value (if available in the data set maintained by the data provider) or the value of _void._ A _void_ value shall imply that no corresponding value is contained in the source spatial data set maintained by the data provider or no corresponding value can be derived from existing values at reasonable costs.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 2*

The reason for a _void_ value should be provided where possible using a listed value from the VoidReasonValue code list to indicate the reason for the missing value.

====

The VoidReasonValue type is a code list, which includes the following pre-defined values:

* _Unpopulated_: The property is not part of the dataset maintained by the data provider. However, the characteristic may exist in the real world. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" has not been included in a dataset containing lake spatial objects, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unpopulated'. The property receives this value for all spatial objects in the spatial data set.
* _Unknown_: The correct value for the specific spatial object is not known to, and not computable by the data provider. However, a correct value may exist. For example when the "elevation of the water body above the sea level" _of a certain lake_ has not been measured, then the reason for a void value of this property would be 'Unknown'. This value is applied only to those spatial objects where the property in question is not known.
* _Withheld_: The characteristic may exist, but is confidential and not divulged by the data provider.

NOTE It is possible that additional reasons will be identified in the future, in particular to support reasons / special values in coverage ranges.

The Â«voidableÂ» stereotype does not give any information on whether or not a characteristic exists in the real world. This is expressed using the multiplicity:

* If a characteristic may or may not exist in the real world, its minimum cardinality shall be defined as 0. For example, if an Address may or may not have a house number, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 0..1.
* If at least one value for a certain characteristic exists in the real world, the minimum cardinality shall be defined as 1. For example, if an Administrative Unit always has at least one name, the multiplicity of the corresponding property shall be 1..*.

In both cases, the Â«voidableÂ» stereotype can be applied. In cases where the minimum multiplicity is 0, the absence of a value indicates that it is known that no value exists, whereas a value of void indicates that it is not known whether a value exists or not.

EXAMPLE If an address does not have a house number, the corresponding Address object should not have any value for the Â«voidableÂ» attribute house number. If the house number is simply not known or not populated in the data set, the Address object should receive a value of _void_ (with the corresponding void reason) for the house number attribute.

==== Enumerations

Enumerations are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values are modelled as attributes of the enumeration class using the following modelling style:

* No initial value, but only the attribute name part, is used.
* The attribute name conforms to the rules for attributes names, i.e. is a lowerCamelCase name. Exceptions are words that consist of all uppercase letters (acronyms).

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 6
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

5) Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types that have an enumeration type may only take values from the lists specified for the enumeration type."

====

==== Code lists

Code lists are modelled as classes in the application schemas. Their values, however, are managed outside of the application schema.

===== Code list types

The IRs distinguish the following types of code lists.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 6
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

1) Code lists shall be of one of the following types, as specified in the Annexes:

.. code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in this Regulation;

.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and narrower values defined by data providers;

.. code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in this Regulation and additional values at any level defined by data providers;

.. code lists, whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers.

For the purposes of points (b), (c) and (d), in addition to the allowed values, data providers may use the values specified in the relevant INSPIRE Technical Guidance document available on the INSPIRE web site of the Joint Research Centre.

====

The type of code list is represented in the UML model through the tagged value _extensibility_, which can take the following values:

* _none_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise only the values specified in the IRs (type a);
* _narrower_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and narrower values defined by data providers (type b);
* _open_, representing code lists whose allowed values comprise the values specified in the IRs and additional values at any level defined by data providers (type c); and
* _any_, representing code lists, for which the IRs do not specify any allowed values, i.e. whose allowed values comprise any values defined by data providers (type d).

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 3*

Additional values defined by data providers should not replace or redefine any value already specified in the IRs.

====

NOTE This data specification may specify recommended values for some of the code lists of type (b), (c) and (d) (see section 5.2.4.3). These recommended values are specified in a dedicated Annex.

In addition, code lists can be hierarchical, as explained in Article 6(2) of the IRs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 6
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(...)

2) Code lists may be hierarchical. Values of hierarchical code lists may have a more generic parent value. Where the valid values of a hierarchical code list are specified in a table in this Regulation, the parent values are listed in the last column.

====

The type of code list and whether it is hierarchical or not is also indicated in the feature catalogues.

===== Obligations on data providers

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
Article 6
*Code Lists and Enumerations*

(....)

3) Where, for an attribute whose type is a code list as referred to in points (b), (c) or (d) of paragraph 1, a data provider provides a value that is not specified in this Regulation, that value and its definition shall be made available in a register.

4) Attributes or association roles of spatial object types or data types whose type is a code list may only take values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list.

====

Article 6(4) obliges data providers to use only values that are allowed according to the specification of the code list. The "allowed values according to the specification of the code list" are the values explicitly defined in the IRs plus (in the case of code lists of type (b), (c) and (d)) additional values defined by data providers.

For attributes whose type is a code list of type (b), (c) or (d) data providers may use additional values that are not defined in the IRs. Article 6(3) requires that such additional values and their definition be made available in a register. This enables users of the data to look up the meaning of the additional values used in a data set, and also facilitates the re-use of additional values by other data providers (potentially across Member States).

NOTE Guidelines for setting up registers for additional values and how to register additional values in these registers is still an open discussion point between Member States and the Commission.

===== Recommended code list values

For code lists of type (b), (c) and (d), this data specification may propose additional values as a recommendation (in a dedicated Annex). These values will be included in the INSPIRE code list register. This will facilitate and encourage the usage of the recommended values by data providers since the obligation to make additional values defined by data providers available in a register (see section 5.2.4.2) is already met.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 4*

Where these Technical Guidelines recommend values for a code list in addition to those specified in the IRs, these values should be used.

====

NOTE For some code lists of type (d), no values may be specified in these Technical Guidelines. In these cases, any additional value defined by data providers may be used.

===== Governance

The following two types of code lists are distinguished in INSPIRE:

* _Code lists that are governed by INSPIRE (INSPIRE-governed code lists)._ These code lists will be managed centrally in the INSPIRE code list register. Change requests to these code lists (e.g. to add, deprecate or supersede values) are processed and decided upon using the INSPIRE code list register's maintenance workflows. +
 +
INSPIRE-governed code lists will be made available in the INSPIRE code list register at __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>. They will be available in SKOS/RDF, XML and HTML. The maintenance will follow the procedures defined in ISO 19135. This means that the only allowed changes to a code list are the addition, deprecation or supersession of values, i.e. no value will ever be deleted, but only receive different statuses (valid, deprecated, superseded). Identifiers for values of INSPIRE-governed code lists are constructed using the pattern __http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<CodeListName__>/<value>.

* _Code lists that are governed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE (externally governed code lists)._ These code lists are managed by an organisation outside of INSPIRE, e.g. the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) or the World Health Organization (WHO). Change requests to these code lists follow the maintenance workflows defined by the maintaining organisations. Note that in some cases, no such workflows may be formally defined. +
 +
Since the updates of externally governed code lists is outside the control of INSPIRE, the IRs and these Technical Guidelines reference a specific version for such code lists. +
 +
The tables describing externally governed code lists in this section contain the following columns:
** The _Governance_ column describes the external organisation that is responsible for maintaining the code list.
** The _Source_ column specifies a citation for the authoritative source for the values of the code list. For code lists, whose values are mandated in the IRs, this citation should include the version of the code list used in INSPIRE. The version can be specified using a version number or the publication date. For code list values recommended in these Technical Guidelines, the citation may refer to the "latest available version".
** In some cases, for INSPIRE only a subset of an externally governed code list is relevant. The subset is specified using the _Subset_ column.
** The _Availability_ column specifies from where (e.g. URL) the values of the externally governed code list are available, and in which formats. Formats can include machine-readable (e.g. SKOS/RDF, XML) or human-readable (e.g. HTML, PDF) ones. +

Code list values are encoded using http URIs and labels. Rules for generating these URIs and labels are specified in a separate table.

[NOTE]
====
*Recomendation 5*

The http URIs and labels used for encoding code list values should be taken from the INSPIRE code list registry for INSPIRE-governed code lists and generated according to the relevant rules specified for externally governed code lists.

====

NOTE Where practicable, the INSPIRE code list register could also provide http URIs and labels for externally governed code lists.

===== Vocabulary

For each code list, a tagged value called "vocabulary" is specified to define a URI identifying the values of the code list. For INSPIRE-governed code lists and externally governed code lists that do not have a persistent identifier, the URI is constructed following the pattern _http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/<UpperCamelCaseName_.

If the value is missing or empty, this indicates an empty code list. If no sub-classes are defined for this empty code list, this means that any code list may be used that meets the given definition.

An empty code list may also be used as a super-class for a number of specific code lists whose values may be used to specify the attribute value. If the sub-classes specified in the model represent all valid extensions to the empty code list, the subtyping relationship is qualified with the standard UML constraint "\{complete,disjoint}".

==== Identifier management

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Article 9_
*Identifier Management*

1. The data type Identifier defined in Section 2.1 of Annex I shall be used as a type for the external object identifier of a spatial object.

2. The external object identifier for the unique identification of spatial objects shall not be changed during the life-cycle of a spatial object.

====

(ed.), OpenGISÂ® Implementation Standard for Geographic information â€“ Simple feature access â€“ Part 1: Common architecture, version 1.2.1, Open Geospatial Consortium, 2011, unless specified otherwise for a specific spatial data theme or type.

====

NOTE 1 The specification restricts the spatial schema to 0-, 1-, 2-, and 2.5-dimensional geometries where all curve interpolations are linear and surface interpolations are performed by triangles.

NOTE 2 The topological relations of two spatial objects based on their specific geometry and topology properties can in principle be investigated by invoking the operations of the types defined in ISO 19107 (or the methods specified in EN ISO 19125-1).

====  Temporality representation

The application schema(s) use(s) the derived attributes "beginLifespanVersion" and "endLifespanVersion" to record the lifespan of a spatial object.

The attributes "beginLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was inserted or changed in the spatial data set. The attribute "endLifespanVersion" specifies the date and time at which this version of the spatial object was superseded or retired in the spatial data set.

NOTE 1 The attributes specify the beginning of the lifespan of the version in the spatial data set itself, which is different from the temporal characteristics of the real-world phenomenon described by the spatial object. This lifespan information, if available, supports mainly two requirements: First, knowledge about the spatial data set content at a specific time; second, knowledge about changes to a data set in a specific time frame. The lifespan information should be as detailed as in the data set (i.e., if the lifespan information in the data set includes seconds, the seconds should be represented in data published in INSPIRE) and include time zone information.

NOTE 2 Changes to the attribute "endLifespanVersion" does not trigger a change in the attribute "beginLifespanVersion".

==== Coverages

Coverage functions are used to describe characteristics of real-world phenomena that vary over space and/or time. Typical examples are temperature, elevation, precipitation, imagery. A coverage contains a set of such values, each associated with one of the elements in a spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal domain. Typical spatial domains are point sets (e.g. sensor locations), curve sets (e.g. isolines), grids (e.g. orthoimages, elevation models), etc.

In INSPIRE application schemas, coverage functions are defined as properties of spatial object types where the type of the property value is a realisation of one of the types specified in ISO 19123.

To improve alignment with coverage standards on the implementation level (e.g. ISO 19136 and the OGC Web Coverage Service) and to improve the cross-theme harmonisation on the use of coverages in INSPIRE, an application schema for coverage types is included in the Generic Conceptual Model in 9.9.4. This application schema contains the following coverage types:

* _RectifiedGridCoverage_: coverage whose domain consists of a rectified grid â€“ a grid for which there is an affine transformation between the grid coordinates and the coordinates of a coordinate reference system (see Figure 5, left).
* _ReferenceableGridCoverage_: coverage whose domain consists of a referenceable grid â€“ a grid associated with a transformation that can be used to convert grid coordinate values to values of coordinates referenced to a coordinate reference system (see Figure 5, right).

In addition, some themes make reference to the types TimeValuePair and Timeseries defined in Taylor, Peter (ed.), _OGC^Â®^ WaterML 2.0: Part 1 â€“ Timeseries, v2.0.0,_ Open Geospatial Consortium, 2012. These provide a representation of the time instant/value pairs, i.e. time series (see Figure 6).

Where possible, only these coverage types (or a subtype thereof) are used in INSPIRE application schemas.

=== Application schema SOIL

==== Description

The Soil Model described in this chapter contains the essential elements of a data model that allows the exchange of geo-referenced soil data. The model is described in UML, which is then used as a base for the generation of XML Schema Definition (or .xsd) files, which in turn define the XML format that is to be used for the actual exchange of data.

===== Narrative description

The major spatial object types that can be distinguished in the Soil data model are:

* SoilProfile (including Observed and Derived Soil Profiles)
* ProfileElement (including SoilLayer and SoilHorizon)
* SoilBody
* SoilDerivedObject
* SoilThemeCoverage and SoilThemeDescriptiveCoverage
* SoilSite
* SoilPlot

Their meaning and relationships are explained in the following paragraphs. All objects, apart from SoilThemeCoverage and SoilThemeDescriptiveCoverage, are presented in Figure 7â€“ Vector, while Figure 8 presents the UML class diagram for these objects. The used data types and codelists are illustrated in and Figure 9 and Figure 10. The relation to Observations and Measurements is illustrated in Figure 11.

====== _Soil Profile, Layer and Horizon_

The concepts of "observed soil profile" and "derived soil profile" are represented through the classes _ObservedSoilProfile_ and _DerivedSoilProfile_ that are subtypes of the abstract class _SoilProfile_. (see Figure 7)

An observed soil profile represents a geo-referenced soil profile, described in the field, possibly sampled and analyzed in the laboratory.

A derived soil profile is a non-point-located soil profile with property values that are derived (e.g. averaged) from the values of the corresponding properties of one or more observed soil profiles. Even if such a connection to an observed soil profile exists, it is not mandatory to provide it (nor its data) together with the derived soil profile. Eventually, a derived soil profile could also be a standalone non-geo-referenced soil profile, not associated to an observed soil profile and with property values that are e.g. assessed by expert knowledge.

Any soil profile can be characterized as a whole by a number of properties, of which the following are included in the model: its soil type according to the WRB soil classification scheme (_WRBSoilName_) and/or any other soil classification scheme (_otherSoilName_) with the limitation to one per dataset, and zero or more other parameters, which are expressed through _soilProfileObservation_ associations with _OM_Observation_ objects (see Figure 11). Through the _observedProperty_ role of its _Phenomenon_ association, the _OM_Observation_ object designates the parameter, through the attributes _label_, _basePhenomenon_ (value selected from the codelist _SoilProfileParameterNameValue_) (see Figre 10) and _uom_ (unit of measure). Through the _result_ role of the _Range_ association, a value can be given to the parameter; this value should be of the type _Number_, _RangeType_ (a range of values) or _CharacterString_ (e.g. 'good' or 'very high'). Note that the _SoilProfileParameterNameValue_ codelist can be extended by the data provider when needed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex IV / Section 3.4._
*Theme specific requirement*

Only one Other Soil Name Type classification shall be used for a dataset.
====

To promote semantic interoperability and when possible, it is required to use WRB as a classification scheme. On top of _inspireID_, any soil profile can also be identified by a _localIdentifier_, which is a character string that allows tagging of the profile object with any information that relates the object to the originating data source of the data provider.

Note that the _WRBSoilName_ is of type _WRBSoilNameType_ that allows to give _WRBSoilName_ a value according to the WRB structure defined for the WRB2006 update 2007 or later versions. The reference to the WRB version which is actually used is encoded through the values taken from the WRB related codelists (_WRBReferenceSoilGroupValue_, _WRBQualifierValue,_ _WRBSpecifierValue_ and _WRBQualifierPlaceValue_). If a _SoilProfile_ is to be characterized by earlier versions of WRB (e.g. 1998), the _otherSoilName_ attribute should be used.

Any instance of an _ObservedSoilProfile_ is associated to exactly one instance of a _soilPlot_ (see further) from which the _soilPlotLocation_ attribute indicates the position (i.e. where it is located on the earth's surface) and for which the soil data provides valid information.

Any soil profile, whether observed or derived, can be described by horizons and layers. Each horizon and layer can have a number of properties. In the model, layers and horizons are represented by the classes _SoiLayer_ and _SoilHorizon_ which are both subtypes of the abstract class _ProfileElement_. The abstract _SoilProfile_ can consist of one or more __ProfileElement__s.

A horizon or layer is at least characterized by an upper depth and a lower depth, indicating the top and the bottom depth of the horizon or layer from the surface; the attribute in the abstract _ProfileElement_ class that indicates the depths of a horizon or layer is _profileElementDepthRange_.

The properties of horizons and layers are modelled through the _profileElementObservation associations_ with _OM_Observation_ objects (see Figure 11), in the same way as soil profile parameters are modelled, the only difference being that the parameter is selected from the codelist ProfileElementParameterNameValue (see Figure 10). Note that this codelist can be extended by the data provider when needed.

A horizon is further specified by a horizon name according to the FAO horizon notation scheme from 2006 (_FAOHorizonNotation_) and/or any other horizon notation schemes (_otherHorizonNotation_), with the limitation to one per a dataset. A horizon corresponds to a horizontal subdivision of the soil based on pedogenic processes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex IV / Section 3.4_
*Theme specific requirement*

Only one Other Horizon Notation Type classification shall be used for a dataset.
====

A layer corresponds to a horizontal subdivision of the soil based on other criteria than pedogenic processes. The way of defining a layer is specified by a layer type name that indicates the kind of layer considered: _topsoil_, _subsoil_, d__epthInterval__ or _geogenic_; this is modelled through the _layerType_ attribute in the _SoilLayer_ class. _Topsoil_ and _subsoil_ are complementary concepts used to address pedogenic process domains of the soil irrespective of a horizon description. Depth intervals are often used for chemical characterisation of the soil state and relate often to sampling depths. If the _SoilLayer_ is of the type _geogenic_, it is described in terms of its non-pedogenic origin and can additionally be described by the following attributes: _layerRockType_ (which gives petrographic or lithologic information on the rock type the layer is made of) and three attributes with reference to layer genesis (_layerGenesisProcess_, _layerGenesisEnvironment_, _layerGenesisProcessState_). Except for _layerGenesisProcessState_, the involved codelists originate from the INSPIRE Data Specification on Geology.

Note that the values in the codelists _SoilProfileParameterNameValue_ and _ProfileElementParameterNameValue_ (see Figure 10) in this version of the model correspond to requirements concerning soil property data in some European legislation.

Note that, since the parameters for _soilProfile_, _ProfileElement_ and _soilDerivedObject_ (see below) are linked (through the O&M framework, see Figure 11)) to _OM_Observation_, which in turn is associated to _INSPIRE_OM_Process_, it is possible to provide additional information on the process that led to observation values. For example, if soil pH is measured in a salt solution, the kind and concentration of the salt solution as well as the solution to soil proportion and the type of device used can be stated.

*IR Requirement*
_Annex IV / Section 3.4_
*Theme specific requirement*

The values of the first level hierarchical code lists: ProfileElementParameterNameValue, SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue, SoilProfileParameterNameValue, SoilSiteParameterNameValue (chemicalParameter, biologicalParameter, physicalParameter) serve only the purpose of structuring; only the lower-level values shall be used.
====

====== _SoilBody_

To delineate geographically areas with a soil cover that can be characterized by a set of derived soil profiles, the model introduces the construct of the _SoilBody_ class (see Figure 7). It represents an association (or other types of spatial linkages of various soil types) of derived soil profiles that represent the soils found together in the area of the _SoilBody_. The area is specified by the _geometry_ attribute of the _SoilBody_. The presence of one or more kinds of soils in the _SoilBody_ is modelled with the association class _DerivedProfilePresenceInSoilBody_, which allows to indicate which derived soil profiles are used to describe the soils of the _SoilBody_, and to which extent (expressed as a couple of area share percentages). The couple of percentages offer the flexibility to give a range of percentages to express uncertainty on the presence of any soil type. If only one percentage value is to be used, lower and upper boundaries of the couple of percentages should have identical values. Because of this flexibility with ranges of percentages, it is allowed that the sum of all percentage upper boundaries for the derived soil profiles in one soil body is greater than 100%. However, there is the constraint that the sum of all percentage lower boundaries for the derived soil profiles in one soil body is lower than or equal to 100%.

As an example, a _SoilBody_ could consist of one dominant soil (as described by a derived soil profile) and of other soils (described by other derived soil profiles) having characteristics different from the dominant one. A derived soil profile can be used to characterize more than one _SoilBody_.

The _soilBodyLabel_ attribute of the _SoilBody_ allows a description of the _SoilBody_, which may be useful for building legends. The _soilBodyLabel_ contributes to the explanation of a mapping unit of a map, whereas in the metadata linked to the dataset to which the object belongs, a reference should be given to documentation that further explains the labelling of the soil bodies.

Note that although the geometry (polygon areas) of the _SoilBody_ is known and also how much area within it is covered by each of the soils in the area, expressed as a range of percentages, the exact location and spatial pattern of each kind of soils within the _SoilBody_ is not defined.

====== _SoilDerivedObject_

In the context of the model, a _SoilDerivedObject_ (Figure 7) is defined as a spatial object (e.g. a point, line, polygon) representing a soil-related property (using the association _soilDerivedObjectObservation_ with an OM_Observation object, see Figure 11) which value can be (but does not have to be) derived from a) values of soil properties of related observed soil profiles and/or related soil bodies, and/or b) any other data or information intern or extern to the model (for example: instances of other SoilDerivedObjects (intern); landcover/climate data (extern)). A collection of such _SoilDerivedObjects_ constitutes a soil thematic map, and is to be regarded as a dataset. The metadata linked to such a dataset provides the details on how the values for the attributes of the __SoilDerivedObject__s have been calculated.

The _geometry_ attribute of the _SoilDerivedObject_ specifies type and location of the geographical object (e.g. a polygon or a point). Through the association _soilDerivedObjectObservation_ with an OM_Observation object, a parameter is designated and given a value, in the same way as parameters for the soil profiles and profile elements. The parameter is selected from the codelist _SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue_ (see Figure 10); note that this code list can be extended by the data provider when needed.

At _SoilDerivedObject_ object level__,__ the value for the associated parameter in the associated OM_Observation object can be accompanied by zero or more values that provide supplementary information to it. This information is given in zero or more _parameter_ attributes of the _OM_Observation_ object and which values are of the type _NamedValue_. The class _NamedValue_ provides for a generic soft-typed parameter value. NamedValue supports two attributes: _name_ (datatype: _GenericName_) that indicates the meaning of the named value, and _value_ (datatype: _Any_) that provides the value. The type _Any_ should be substituted by a suitable concrete type, e.g. _Number_.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[.text-center]
*IR Requirement*
_Annex IV / Section 3.4_
*Theme specific requirement*

When an additional descriptive parameter for the soil derived object is needed, the parameter attribute of the OM_Observation spatial object type shall be used.
====

One example of the use of the _parameter_ attribute in the _OM_Observation_ object is for the construction of so-called "purity maps". When one wants to construct a _SoilDerivedObject_ with as geometry a polygon P and with a parameter that contains a value indicating a soil property A (e.g. WaterDrainageClass), based on values for that same property that are found in the _DerivedSoilProfile_-s associated to a _SoilBody_ covering the same polygon, one could select the value for WaterDrainageClass for the _DerivedSoilProfile_ that is dominant. This is an interpretation of the data and when depicting A as a value in polygon P, the viewer should know that this value is not "pure" and that an amount of information is lost through interpretation. The "purity" of the value for A could be indicated in the _parameter_ attribute of the linked _OM_Observation_ object__,__ which could have a NamedValue consisting of name _purity_ and a value between 0 and 100__,__ computed from the proportions of the _DerivedSoilProfiles_ composing the _SoilBody_.

Because the multiplicity of the associations between the _SoilDerivedObject_ and the _SoilBody_ and _ObservedSoilProfile_ is "0..*" (i.e. zero to many), the _SoilDerivedObject_ class also accommodates for so-called "soil thematic maps" in which the spatial information on a soil property is *not* related to any of the soil objects in the model.

Note that the set of name values in the codelist _SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue_ in this version of the model corresponds to the union of name values of the code lists _SoilProfileParameterNameValue_ and _ProfileElementParameterNameValue_, which in turn correspond to requirements concerning soil property data in some European legislation.

A collection of __SoilDerivedObject__s that may consist of points, lines and/or polygons, is not meant for the exchange of soil thematic data as raster datasets. This feature is implemented with the _SoilThemeCoverage_ class__.__

====== _SoilThemeCoverage, SoilThemeDescriptiveCoverage_

The specific purpose of the _SoilThemeCoverage_ class (see Figure 8) is to provide a structure for the interchange of soil thematic maps as continuous phenomena. The geometry is represented as a coverage which is defined as a "feature that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal domain". For soil this commonly is a rectified grid.

The attribute _soilThemeParameter_ is of the datatype _SoilThemeParameterType_ that consists of a _soilThemeParameterName_ (to be taken from the codelist _SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue_, e.g. _organicCarbonContent_) (see Figure 10) and a unit of measure (e.g. cm). Note that the code list _SoilDerivedObjectParameterNameValue_ can be extended by the data provider when needed.

The values of the gridcells are covered by a rangeSet constraint that says that values shall be of one of the types Number; RangeType or CharacterString.

Since it may be useful to associate to a coverage other coverages of which the cell values are supplementary information to the corresponding grid cells of the coverage itself, the _SoilThemeCoverage_ class has an association to another coverage, the _SoilThemeDescriptiveCoverage_. The _SoilThemeDescriptiveCoverage_ has the same spatial and domain extent as the associated _SoilThemeCoverage_. The attribute _soilThemeDescriptiveParameter_ is of the datatype _SoilThemeDescriptiveParameterType_ that consists of a _soilThemeDescriptiveParameterName_ (characterstring, e.g. _purity_) and a unit of measure (e.g. cm). The _soilThemeDescriptiveParameter_ gives supplementary information on the grid cell values of the associated coverage, often it concerns qualitative information. An example would be the provision of "purity maps" in relation to for instance soil texture maps.

====== _SoilSite, SoilPlot_

A "soil site" is considered as a wider geographical area, i.e. the larger piece of land where soil investigation takes place in one or more spots, called soil plots. A site represents often just the geographically not strictly defined environment of the plots; thus, the geometry attribute of the soil site can be a surface or a point location. In soil survey and general soil monitoring, all soil information gathered on one site is handled as if it would have been collected at the very same location, which is impossible in the strict sense in the real world whenever soil investigation is destructive. The purpose of this investigation can be general (e.g. taking soil profiles for a general soil characterization) or specific (e.g. sampling to investigate potentially contaminated land). The soil plot object is included in the model to provide the type and location of the associated observed soil profile. A soil plot within a soil site is of a certain type (_borehole_, _sample_, _trial pit_) and located by a geographical point and/or the name of a location.

To a soil plot, one observed soil profile must be associated.

A soil site is represented in the model with the _SoilSite_ class (see Figure 7). Its _soilInvestigationPurpose_ attribute indicates the purpose of investigation: general (_generalSoilSurvey_) or specific (_specificSoilSurvey_). This kind of information can be crucial for data evaluation to identify bias in the selection of sites.

The possible properties of a soil site are modelled through the _soilSiteObservation associations_ with _OM_Observation_ objects (see Figure 11), in the same way as soil profile parameters are modelled, the only difference being that the parameter is selected from the codelist _SoilSiteParameterNameValue_. Note that this codelist can be extended by the data provider when needed.

A soil plot is represented in the model with the _SoilPlot_ class. A _SoilSite_ comprises one or more __SoilPlot-__s. A soil plot is of a certain type (_soilPlotType_), and its location is indicated by the attribute _soilPlotLocation_ which can take the form of either a specific X,Y-location or a description of the location using text or an identifier.

====== _Note on Observations_

For the data specifications of soil, the Observations & Measurements standard (O & M) is used (see Figure 11). The Observations & Measurements standard defines a domain-independent conceptual model for the representation of (spatiotemporal) measurement and other observation data. ISO 19156 defines an application schema as a reference schema for data required by one or more applications. O & M can be used as a generic means to deal with measurements and other observations in a standardized way. From that standard, _OM_Observation_ is used in the soil model; from the INSPIRE O&M package, the _INSPIRE_OM_Process_ and the data type _ObservableProperty_ are used in the soil model. This means that for each observation the _phenomenonTime_ and _resultTime_ are always used and additional properties may be used. The _resultTime_ for soil is usually the same time as the _PhenomenonTime_ unless the analysis is not carried out in the field. For the process information, at least a name and a responsible party have to be provided. Additionally, other properties that refer to online or offline documentation can be used. When needed, process parameters can be provided. For instance, for the soil profile parameter with the name carbonStock, which is placed in the _basePhenomenon_ attribute of the _ObservableProperty_ type, the _processParameter_ attribute of the _INSPIRE_OM_Process_ class (that is linked to the _ObservableProperty_) could hold a value that indicates the depth to which this carbonStock value pertains.

In the model, all the information related to the observation is considered to be the evidence of the value of the property belonging to the feature of interest (i.e. the relevant soil object). This evidence is associated to the feature of interest. In the soil application schema, this is associated to either _soilProfile_, _ProfileElement_, _SoilDerivedObject_ or _SoilSite_ as being the "feature of interest".

NOTE 1 If several derived soil profiles are used to describe the soil body, the spatial distribution of the soil they describe within the soil body is not defined, but their presence is indicated by a range percentage of area. The underlying reason behind the fact of not delineating the different soils within a soil body is the target scale of the map or spatial dataset. This means that geographical accuracy and preciseness of soil characterization depend on and vary with the target scale, i.e. the soil body can be delineated differently among scales.

!Â  !Subtype of: !ProfileElement
!Â  !Definition: !domain of a soil with a certain vertical extension developed through non-pedogenic processes, displaying a change in structure and/or composition to possibly over- or underlying adjacent domains, or a grouping of soil horizons or other sub-domains with a special purpose.
!Â  !Description: !NOTE1 Different kinds of layer concepts are covered by this definition. 
 
EXAMPLE 1 Geogenic layers: These are domains, resulting from e.g. sedimentation (as non-pedogenic) processes, that display an unconformity to possibly over- or underlying adjacent domains. 
 
EXAMPLE 2 Topsoil and Subsoil: These can be domains that group different soil horizon types (e.g. A vs. B horizons), or a special case of fixed depths with only two depth ranges (e.g. 0-15 cm: topsoil and, 15-75 cm: subsoil). 
 
EXAMPLE 3 Depth intervals: They are often used in soil monitoring, sampling of contaminated sites and in modelling and include: (i) depth increments (also called fixed depths) that are often used for sampling, e.g. 0-30cm, 30-60cm, and so on, (ii) a single depth range in which a soil sample ("specimen") is taken and for which the analytical result is valid, and (iii) soil slicing, that is, profile segmentation according to a specified vector, for instance, either regularly spaced intervals (1cm), or a user-defined vector of segment boundaries (i.e. 0-10, 10-25, 25-50, 50-100). Slicing is used in modelling to generate continuous depth functions for soil properties. 
 
EXAMPLE 4: In the framework of soils deeply modified by human activity, artificial layers may be due to different kinds of deposits (concrete, bricks, ...).

[width="100%",cols="5%,17%,78%"]
!===
!Â  !Name: !soil site
!Â  !Definition: !area within a larger survey, study or monitored area, where a specific soil investigation is carried out.
!Â  !Description: !Site provides the object to describe: 
a.) the surroundings of the plot 
 
and/or 
 
b.) the larger piece of land that is directly linked to and described by all soil investigations on its one or more spots (SoilPlots). It thus provides the object to which soil data of different kind (or the same kind, but at different points in time, e.g. in soil monitoring) obtained on different plots is related as if it would have been collected at the very same place. This allows for: 
 
1. combination of data that cannot be obtained on the very same place 
EXAMPLE: a soil pit and investigations on earthworm abundance cannot be done in the same place, but possibly some metres apart from each other. Nonetheless shall the results of both investigations be combined to inform about the soil state. 
or 
2. comparison of soil condition after some time has elapsed. 
EXAMPLE: Organic carbon stock has been investigated using data from two monitoring periods that had to be conducted on spatially slightly separated places because the sampling is destructive. Nonetheless are the results of both periods regarded as giving an idea how organic carbon stock has changed over the years at the same place. 
 
The site is also the object to state the date and time information on validity, etc. 
 
The soil site might have delineation, but can be located with a centre or reference point location only. Delineated soil sites - possibly in the form of cadastral parcels - are especially used in the inventory of contaminated areas. 
 
NOTE Any plot can be linked to one specific site only, but several plots to one site.

!Â  !Description: !A code system that denotes horizons in which the same dominant soil forming processes has been active similarly. This code summarizes many observations of the soil description and gives an impression about the genetic processes that have formed the soil under observation. 
 
NOTE The horizon notation according to FAO (2006) is a combination of several symbols: 
Â· A number that gives information about discontinuities, i.e. the number of the material in which the soil has formed, counted up from the soil surface, but not for the first material. 
Â· One or two capital letters that designate the type of master horizon (or transitional horizon), possibly separated by a slash 
Â· Lower case letters that designate subordinate characteristics of the horizon. 
Â· A number that designates horizontal subdivisions of otherwise similarly denoted horizon parts 
Â· A prime that enables to distinguish two horizons that have the same naming, but formed in different cycles of pedogenesis.

!Â  !Name: !FAO horizon discontinuity
!Â  !Value type: !Integer
!Â  !Definition: !number used to indicate a discontinuity in the horizon notation.
!Â  !Description: !In mineral soils, Arabic numerals are used as prefixes to indicate discontinuities. Wherever needed, they are used preceding A, E, B, C and R. They are not used with I and W, although these symbols clearly indicate a discontinuity. These prefixes are distinct from Arabic numerals used as suffixes to denote vertical subdivisions. 
A discontinuity is a significant change in particle-size distribution or mineralogy that indicates a difference in the material from which the horizons formed or a significant difference in age or both, unless that difference in age is indicated by the suffix b. Symbols to identify discontinuities are used only when they will contribute substantially to the reader's understanding of relationships among horizons. The stratification common in soils formed in alluvium is not designated as discontinuities unless particle-size distribution differs markedly from layer to layer even though genetic horizons have formed in the contrasting layers. 
Where a soil has formed entirely in one kind of material, a prefix is omitted from the symbol; the whole profile is material 1. Similarly, the uppermost material in a profile having two or more contrasting materials is understood to be material 1, but the number is omitted. Numbering starts with the second layer of contrasting material, which is designated 2. Underlying contrasting layers are numbered consecutively.

The sequence A-E-Bt-E-Btx-C is an example - the soil has two E horizons. To make communication easier, a prime is used with the master horizon symbol of the lower of two horizons having identical letter designations: A-E-Bt-E'-Btx-C.The prime is applied to the capital letter designation, and any lower case symbol follows it: B't. The prime is not used unless all letters of the designations of two different layers are identical. Prime can be used for both minerals or organic soils.
